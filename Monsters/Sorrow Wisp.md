## Physical Vulnerability Mechanics

**Why It Can Be Hit Physically:**
- Sorrow wisps are manifestations of intense emotional trauma
- Their grief is so profound it gives them semi-corporeal form
- Physical attacks disrupt the emotional energy holding them together
- They're "solid" enough that determination and force of will can harm them

**Tactical Implications:**
- Unlike typical incorporeal undead, all weapon attacks can hit them
- Still resistant to non-magical physical damage (but not immune)
- Radiant damage is particularly effective (destroys the sorrow)
- Psychic damage heals them instead of harming (they feed on emotional pain)

## Items
- None (pure spiritual manifestation)
- May leave behind mementos of their mortal tragedy when destroyed

## DM Notes & Key Info
**Role:** Psychological warfare and morale destruction

**Tactical Notes:**
- Focuses on spreading fear and despair
- Disrupts healing and support abilities
- Most effective against already weakened or frightened enemies
- Vulnerable to high-morale parties with strong leadership

**Vorlag's Use:**
- Weakening enemy resolve before major battles
- Haunting sites to prevent recovery and rest
- Breaking the spirit of captured enemies
- Creating atmosphere of hopelessness

## Description
**Physical Appearance:**
Translucent, weeping humanoid figure roughly the size of a child. Features shift between different faces - all showing expressions of profound loss. Constantly sheds spectral tears that vanish before hitting the ground. Moves with slow, mournful gestures.

**Behavior:**
- Drawn to sites of recent tragedy or loss
- Attempts to share its sorrow with living creatures
- Becomes more solid and dangerous when around grieving people
- Fades when exposed to genuine joy or hope

## Origin
Created from the deaths of innocents or from places where great tragedies occurred. They represent grief so intense it cannot pass on to the afterlife, instead lingering to spread their anguish to the living.

## Variants
- **Rage Wisp:** Anger-based spirit, deals fire damage and causes berserk rage
- **Terror Wisp:** Fear-based spirit, has invisibility and induces panic
