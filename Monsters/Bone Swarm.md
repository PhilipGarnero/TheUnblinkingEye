traits:
  - name: "Swarm"
    desc: "The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny bone fragment. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points."
  - name: "Flowing Mass"
    desc: "The swarm can squeeze through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. When moving through such spaces, its speed is reduced to 10 feet."
  - name: "Grasping Bones"
    desc: "Creatures that start their turn in the swarm's space are grappled (escape DC 12). A grappled creature has its movement speed reduced by half and takes 5 (1d10) piercing damage at the start of its turn."
  - name: "Bone Density"
    desc: "When the swarm has half its hit points or fewer, its AC decreases to 10, and creatures have advantage on saving throws against its abilities."
actions:
  - name: Engulf
    desc: "The swarm moves up to its speed. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the swarm enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the swarm. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, the swarm enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage and is grappled. At the start of each of the swarm's turns, grappled creatures take 9 (2d8) piercing damage. A creature can escape the grapple by succeeding on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check."
  - name: Bone Shard Spray (Recharge 5-6)
    desc: "The swarm launches fragments in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one."

## Swarm Mechanics Details

**Size and Occupation:**
- Occupies 4 adjacent 5-foot squares in a 2x2 formation
- Can reshape to fit through narrow passages (single file, etc.)
- Multiple creatures can be in its space simultaneously

**Damage Scaling:**
- Full health (36-19 HP): All abilities at full power
- Half health (18-1 HP): Reduced AC, advantage on saves against its abilities
- When destroyed: Scatters into harmless bone fragments

**Tactical Behavior:**
- Prioritizes grappling spellcasters and ranged attackers
- Uses engulf to capture multiple enemies
- Flows around obstacles to reach vulnerable targets
- Retreats through small spaces when heavily damaged

## Items
- Thousands of small bone fragments (teeth, finger bones, etc.)
- Occasional small trinkets caught in the mass

## DM Notes & Key Info
**Role:** Crowd control and area denial

**Tactical Notes:**
- Extremely effective against grouped enemies
- Vulnerable to area-of-effect damage
- Forces enemies to spread out
- Difficult to target with single-target effects

**Counters:**
- Area damage (fireball, burning hands, etc.)
- Forced movement effects to scatter the swarm
- Tight formation fighting reduces its effectiveness
- Ranged attacks from elevated positions

**Vorlag's Use:**
- Flushing enemies out of defensive positions
- Overwhelming isolated targets
- Creating chaos in organized enemy formations
- Clearing out confined spaces

## Description
**Physical Appearance:**
Writhing mass of animated bone fragments ranging from tiny teeth to finger bones. Moves like a liquid wave of clicking, scraping calcium. Individual bones constantly shift position within the mass. Creates a sound like rain on stone when moving.

**Behavior:**
- Flows toward largest concentration of living creatures
- Attempts to surround and engulf rather than flee
- Shows primitive pack hunting instincts
- Becomes more erratic and desperate when damaged

## Variants
- **Skull Swarm:** Made of tiny skulls, has fear-inducing gaze
- **Metallic Bone Swarm:** Includes metal fragments, resistance to slashing damage
