## Description

A rotting corpse with dark energy crackling around its form. Wounds leak black ichor instead of blood. Eyes glow with malevolent purple light. The air around it seems to shimmer with corrupt energy.

- Driven by pure malice and hunger
- No intelligence beyond base cunning
- Seeks to spread its curse to others
- Drawn to areas of necromantic power
