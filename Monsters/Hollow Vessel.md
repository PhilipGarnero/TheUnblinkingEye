## Description

Emaciated humanoid figure that seems constantly shifting and unstable. Eyes change color and expression rapidly as different spirits take control. Movements are jerky and inconsistent, as if the body is being controlled by an inexperienced puppeteer.

**Behavior:**
- Personality shifts dramatically and without warning
- May speak in different voices or languages
- Shows internal conflict through physical gestures
- Becomes more erratic when heavily damaged

## Origin
Created when multiple souls are forcibly bound into a single corpse, usually through botched resurrection attempts or necromantic experiments. The competing spirits create constant internal conflict, making the vessel unpredictable and dangerous.

- **Anchored Vessel:** CR 2, bound to specific location but has more stable personality
