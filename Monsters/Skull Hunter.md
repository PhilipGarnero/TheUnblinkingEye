A gaunt, skeletal humanoid with an elongated predatory skull and glowing eye sockets. Its frame is built for speed and stealth, with powerful leg bones for climbing and pouncing. Razor-sharp claws are worn smooth from years of hunting. Most disturbing are the 1d4 victim skulls grotesquely fused to its back, their empty sockets seeming to watch in all directions.

- Takes pride in claiming skulls from victims
- Drawn to areas where prey might hide
