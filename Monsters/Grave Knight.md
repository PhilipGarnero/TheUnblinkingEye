- Guardian of important locations
- Elite soldier for critical missions

- Maintaining semblance of honor among chaotic undead forces

## Description
**Physical Appearance:**
Imposing skeletal warrior in well-maintained plate armor. Bones show signs of noble bearing and military training. Eyes burn with cold blue flame that intensifies during combat. Personal heraldry still visible on shield and armor, though meanings are lost to time.

- Retains martial pride and fighting discipline from life
- Prefers honorable single combat when possible
- Shows respect for worthy opponents
- Maintains equipment with obsessive care
- Follows tactical doctrine even in undeath

## History
Former knights and nobles who died defending their ideals, raised by Vorlag but retaining fragments of their martial honor. They serve not out of mindless compulsion but from a twisted sense of duty to their new liege.
