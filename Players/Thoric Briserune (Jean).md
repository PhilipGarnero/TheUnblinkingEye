## Features & Traits

### Mountain Dwarf Traits

- **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.
- **Darkvision:** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors only as shades of gray.
- **Dwarven Resilience:** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
- **Stonecunning:** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.


### Paladin Features (Level 1)

- **Divine Sense:** As an action, you can open your awareness to detect evil and good. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You also know the type of any such creature you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
- **Lay on Hands:** As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. This feature has no effect on undead or constructs. You have a pool of healing power equal to 5 x your paladin level (5 hit points at level 1).

### Background Feature (Hermit)

- **Inner Calm**: Your extended period of introspection has granted you a serene mind and a deep well of inner peace. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. Furthermore, you can spend one minute in quiet meditation to grant yourself temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use this meditation ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Backstory

This Paladin once served Torm in the esteemed House of the Hand in Procampur, dedicating his life to the god of courage and self-sacrifice. His life took a dark turn after a particularly brutal conflict when his closest friend and fellow warrior, Lysander Grimheart, vanished without a trace. Lysander's disappearance was inexplicable; it seemed as if he simply blinked out of existence, leaving behind only his distraught wife and empty home.

Consumed by worry and a gnawing guilt, the Paladin launched an exhaustive search for Lysander. However, the more he investigated, the more suspicious the circumstances appeared, suggesting something far more sinister than a simple vanishing. Unable to reconcile the facts or find any answers, he ultimately retreated from society, seeking solace and truth in the solitude of a hermit's life. Now, driven by an unshakeable resolve, he journeys endlessly, specifically heading **west**, guided by a faint, persistent hope that answers, and perhaps Lysander, await him there. He is determined to uncover the truth behind his friend's disappearance, no matter how long it takes or how far he must travel.
