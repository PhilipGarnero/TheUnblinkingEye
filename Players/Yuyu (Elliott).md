## Backstory
Abandoned or lost by his family at age 6 during a game of hide-and-seek in the forest, Yuyu survived alone by surrounding himself with wild animals. After 10 years of solitary life, he left his forest to discover new species in the desert.

On the verge of death in the Anauroch desert, Yuyu was rescued by a weathered old goat that led him to an oasis. He noticed an ancient druidic amulet around the animal's neck just before it saved him again, this time from a band of orcs, by carrying him to a hidden canyon lair.

Inside the dusty, forgotten hideout, Yuyu found belongings that had not been touched for centuries. He pieced together the clues: the amulet, the ancient shelter, and the vague stories he'd heard from other travelers about a withered old elf who haunted the desert. Yuyu realized that this goat was in fact Elunar, the very same reclusive elf from the tales, who had lost himself to solitude and forgotten his own past.

Through his persistence, Yuyu helped the ancient elf remember who he was. In doing so, he helped Elunar reclaim his true form, awakening the long-lost druid from centuries of self-imposed exile, though his formidable powers had diminished with time.
