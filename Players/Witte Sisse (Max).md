## Backstory

Witte Sisse hails from the southern slopes of the Desertsmouth Mountains, where he once lived in a secluded temple devoted to **Lathander**, the Morninglord. This temple was little known, intentionally hidden from the world, as it guarded the **Sunstone of Renewal**—a sacred relic long sought by the **Cult of the Dragon**.

### The Sunstone of Renewal
The **Sunstone of Renewal** is a large, flawless crystal about the size of a human heart that glows with an inner golden light. Warm to the touch and pulsing with gentle, life-giving energy, it was blessed by Lathander himself as a testament to the life-giving power of the dawn.

**Sacred Functions:**
- **Beacon of Hope:** Its constant, gentle radiance served as a symbol of Lathander's enduring presence, kept in the central sanctuary where its light bathed the chamber in warm, golden glow
- **Tool for Healing:** When a cleric channeled divine energy through the stone, they could perform great acts of healing, curing diseases, neutralizing poisons, and even regenerating lost limbs
- **Ward Against Undeath:** The stone's light created a hallowed area around the temple, preventing undead creatures from approaching and serving as a key defense for the temple and surrounding community

For years, the monks of the temple lived in peace, shielding the relic through discipline, humility, and secrecy. But eventually, the cult learned of its existence. One grim day, they launched an assault on the temple. Witte was the **only survivor**, narrowly escaping the slaughter as his brothers and sisters were slain.

Traumatized and broken, he fled north, finding solitude and refuge in the mountains. There, he lived as a hermit, with only the **occasional villagers from a nearby settlement** coming to visit. These visits brought him food, offerings, and companionship in exchange for his wisdom and martial teachings. Over time, however, he developed a **taste for alcohol**—a lingering vice from his isolation.

Then, **something changed**. The visits stopped. Days turned into weeks with no sign of the villagers. Curious and worried, Witte descended from his mountain refuge. What he found chilled him: the **village was empty**, and only **scattered signs of battle** remained.

Determined to find out what happened and to **rescue those who might yet live**, he set out toward the **East**, seeking answers—and perhaps, redemption.
