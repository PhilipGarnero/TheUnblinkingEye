## Backstory

Witte Sisse hails from the southern slopes of the Desertsmouth Mountains, where he once lived in a secluded temple devoted to **Lathander**, the Morninglord. This temple was little known, intentionally hidden from the world, as it guarded a **sacred relic**—a powerful artifact long sought by the **Cult of the Dragon**.

For years, the monks of the temple lived in peace, shielding the relic through discipline, humility, and secrecy. But eventually, the cult learned of its existence. One grim day, they launched an assault on the temple. Witte was the **only survivor**, narrowly escaping the slaughter as his brothers and sisters were slain.

Traumatized and broken, he fled north, finding solitude and refuge in the mountains. There, he lived as a hermit, with only the **occasional villagers from a nearby settlement** coming to visit. These visits brought him food, offerings, and companionship in exchange for his wisdom and martial teachings. Over time, however, he developed a **taste for alcohol**—a lingering vice from his isolation.

Then, **something changed**. The visits stopped. Days turned into weeks with no sign of the villagers. Curious and worried, Witte descended from his mountain refuge. What he found chilled him: the **village was empty**, and only **scattered signs of battle** remained.

Determined to find out what happened and to **rescue those who might yet live**, he set out toward the **East**, seeking answers—and perhaps, redemption.
