## Backstory

Elunar, born over 600 years ago, belongs to the Tel'Rethal clan, an ancient line of Circle of the Earth druids who served as guardians of Elvencourt (the elven name for Myth Drannor). His clan was renowned for its mastery of earth magic and its deep connection to the ancient trees, rock spirits, and ley lines. Initiated at a young age, Elunar became a protector of the sacred borders, in constant communion with the druidic stones of the Cormanthor forest.

Known for his quiet and observant nature, he was respected for his wisdom and profound theological knowledge of minerals and sediments, though his fierce temperament made others wary. While never a member of the Council of Elven Lords, he held the rare position of "Counselor of the Natural Voices" and was consulted during times of great imbalance. He was also a distinguished teacher of druidic ways, known then as "Elunar, the Voice of the Stone."

The fall of Myth Drannor and internal conflicts fractured the druidic orders. Some druids turned to forbidden practices, while others made pacts with outside forces or fled to other circles. Refusing to partake in these political shifts, Elunar saw them as a betrayal of the ancient pact with the land. He fled Elvencourt, renounced his clan name, and became a wandering hermit.

He found exile in the Anauroch desert. Stories from bards and travelers speak of a "Guardian of the Dead Stones," now called "the Withered Old One" or "Elunar the Withered." He became a living legend, a master of desert survival, known for his knowledge of every species of cactus and drought-resistant plant, a science he called "the art of the prickly." Legends say that in the heart of the desert, one can still hear the echo of a powerful druidic incantation and see remnants of potent druidic magic.

For two centuries, Elunar was consumed by the wind, solitude, and sun. His skin became like parchment, and his hair dry and wild. He spent so much time in his wild shape, a goat, that he began to forget himself and lose his powers. He was known to tell travelers he saved, "Where man falls to thirst under a burning sun, the goat rises."

Today, there are sightings of an old, weather-beaten goat, yellowed by sand and dust, on the Black Road that crosses the desert, but no trace remains of Elunar the Withered.

Relationship with Yuyu :
Elunar, in his goat form, discovers Yuyu in the desert, dehydrated and near death. He leads him to an oasis to drink and recover. As Yuyu tries to thank the goat, he notices a necklace with druidic symbols around its neck.

Suddenly, Elunar senses a group of orcs approaching. He communicates the danger to Yuyu and gets him to climb onto his back. Elunar then carries him to his secret lair hidden within the canyons.

Inside the hideout, Yuyu finds a place where time seems to have stood still for 200 years, filled with dusty and cobweb-covered druidic belongings. At first, Yuyu wonders if the goat's master will return. Gradually, he realizes that the goat itself is the master of this place—an ancient elf who has forgotten his past. He connects the stories of "Elunar the Withered" to the goat.

Yuyu then helps Elunar reconnect with his true, humanoid form. Through Yuyu's help, Elunar regains his sense of self but discovers that he has lost his former powers.
