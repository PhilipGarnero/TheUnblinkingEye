## Core Campaign Mechanics

### Additional rules
- Injuries on downed creatures : 1d4 for severity (handicap, hindrance, rest, cosmetic)
- Massive damage causes until next turn : nothing, loss of reaction, disadvantage on ability checks, prone, stunned or downed based on 1d6 in that order

### The Death's Eye Curse
- **Minion Attraction**: Draws undead to cursed characters
- **Foe Resurrection**: Slain enemies may rise as skeletons in areas of Vorlag's influence
- **Diminished Vigor**: Reduced healing effectiveness
- **Progressive Effects**: Curse worsens over time if untreated

### Three Main Story Paths
1. **Direct Confrontation**: Hunt down and defeat Vorlag (high risk, high curse interaction)
2. **Seeking Wisdom**: Find magical/divine cure through experts and temples
3. **Sanctuary Flight**: Escape to lands beyond Vorlag's influence

## Important Campaign Notes
- Campaign begins in [[Village of Stillwater Creek]] during/after skeleton attack
- Vorlag curses PCs with [[The Death's Eye]] as punishment for interference
- Curse creates ongoing tension and drives the narrative forward
- Multiple viable solutions allow player agency in approach
- Vault uses Obsidian-style `[[]]` linking for easy navigation

## Campaign Tone
Dark fantasy with themes of curse, undeath, and the struggle against necromantic corruption. Players must balance survival, investigation, and the growing threat of their curse while seeking a cure through one of multiple paths.

## Memory Notes
- Always include links between files
