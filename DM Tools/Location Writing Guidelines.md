# Location Writing Guidelines

Based on campaign analysis and existing locations, here are the guidelines for writing new locations in the Stillwater Vale and beyond.

## Core Requirements

**Must Have At Least One Of:**
1. **Story Advancement**: Direct intelligence about Vorlag, her plans, curse mechanics or ties to player character side stories
2. **Encounters**: Combat, social, or exploration challenges (single session resolvable)
3. **Side Quest**: A new short mission that may be unrelated to the main story
4. **Useful Loot**: Magical items from the loot folder or practical equipment

## Content Guidelines

**Keep It Focused:**
- Remove "generic slop" - no vague knowledge that doesn't help players
- Avoid information that sounds useful but isn't actionable
- No multi-day commitments unless meaningful for the story or quest
- No extended base-building
- Cut unnecessary tactical details (patrol routes, building HP, etc.)

**Loot Distribution:**
- Moderate gold amounts (50-150 gp total)
- Include 1 magical items from the loot folder if the encounter was hard (prefer "useless but magical" items)
- Undead creatures don't usually drop valuable loot
- Make treasure accessible through gameplay, not hidden behind impossible checks

**Story Integration:**
- Connect to main plot: Vorlag's movements, next steps, ritual timeline, anchor locations
- Reference other established locations
- Include specific intelligence with dates and actionable details
- Support at least one of the three main story paths when possible

**Encounter Design:**
- CR 3-6 total for balanced challenge
- Give players meaningful choices (combat vs negotiation vs stealth)
- Single session resolution - avoid ongoing commitments
- Include failure states that aren't campaign-ending

## Structure Template

1. **Overview**: Brief description with clear purpose
2. **Encounter**: Single main challenge with options
3. **Intelligence/Lore**: Specific, actionable information
4. **Loot**: Reasonable rewards from established lists
5. **Connections**: Links to other locations and plot threads

## What to Avoid

- Multi-day waiting quests
- Excessive gold or overpowered equipment
- Generic research that doesn't advance the plot
- Patrol schedules and tactical details that don't matter
- Information gathering that leads nowhere
- Base-building or long-term investment systems

## Examples of Good Information

**Story Advancement:**
- "Vorlag crossed here 3 days ago heading to Saltmere Village"
- "Eclipse timeline: phylactery vulnerable in 30 days"
- "Map shows 5 Shadowfell anchor locations"

The goal is locations that advance the story, provide immediate player benefits, and can be fully resolved in one session without overwhelming detail.
