# Location Writing Guidelines

## Location Importance
The importance of the location will dictate how long our characters will stay in or near it. The larger the location, the more we can allow elements that will span multiple days. However, the larger it is, the more events or information should be present.
For reference:
- **Small** (ruins, well, camp, road, ...)
	- Very few interesting NPCs (< 2)
	- Less than an in-game day of content
- **Medium** (village, dungeon, ...)
	- Some interesting NPCs (< 15), some with side quests
	- A couple of in-game days to a week worth of content
	- Should be a folder to avoid large detailing files
- **Large** (city, region)
	- Should have a dedicated map
	- Includes sub-locations
	- No maximum amount of NPCs (only important ones should be detailed)
	- Lore-wise, once the basis is established, can be developed across multiple sessions

## Core Requirements

**Must Have At Least One Of:**
1. **Story Advancement**: Direct and actionable information or event about the main plot or the player character side stories
2. **Encounters**: Combat, social, or exploration challenges (single session resolvable)
3. **Side Quest**: A new short mission that may be unrelated to the main story
4. **Useful Loot**: Magical items from the loot folder or that you deem fit well and/or practical equipment
5. **Intricate Lore**: Anything that usually falls in these categories (Mystery, History & Myth, Power & Politics, Supernatural, Resources & Economy) or that feels whimsical, quirky or novel.

## Content Guidelines

**Keep It Focused:**
- Remove "generic slop" - no vague knowledge that doesn't help players
- Avoid information that sounds useful but isn't actionable
- No extended base-building unless in large location
- Cut unnecessary tactical details (patrol routes, building HP, etc.)

**Loot Distribution:**
- Adjust item and gold distribution based on the location difficulty
- Most creatures & monsters don't usually drop valuable loot
- Make treasure accessible through gameplay, not hidden behind impossible checks or unsolvable situations

**Balancing Loot with Difficulty:**
- **Low CR (1-3)**: Consumables, basic equipment, small gold amounts (10-50gp), useless magical items
- **Medium CR (4-7)**: Minor magic items, quality equipment, moderate gold (50-200gp)
- **High CR (8+)**: Significant magic items, rare materials, substantial gold (200gp+)
- **Unique/Boss encounters**: Major story-relevant items, powerful equipment
- Consider party level and campaign wealth guidelines from DMG

**Story Integration:**
- Connect to main plot and/or side stories or have its own lore
- Reference other established locations
- Include specific intelligence with dates and actionable details

**Atmosphere & Mood:**
- Establish clear sensory details (what players see, hear, smell)
- Match tone to location purpose (eerie ruins, bustling market, tense negotiations)
- Use environmental storytelling (broken weapons hint at past battles, withered plants suggest corruption)
- Consider time of day and weather effects on mood

**Encounter Design:**
- Ask for which CR should the location be balanced for
- Give players meaningful choices (combat vs negotiation vs stealth vs ...)
- Include failure states that aren't campaign-ending

**Encounter Variety Examples:**
- **Combat**: Direct fights, but consider terrain, objectives beyond "kill everything"
- **Social**: Negotiations, information gathering, reputation building, deception
- **Exploration**: Environmental puzzles, navigation challenges, hidden discoveries
- **Stealth**: Infiltration, avoiding detection, gathering intelligence unnoticed
- **Puzzle**: Riddles, mechanical challenges, code-breaking, pattern recognition
- **Survival**: Resource management, environmental hazards, time pressure

## Structure Template

1. **Overview**: Brief description with clear purpose
2. **Encounters/Quests**: Main challenges with options
3. **Intelligence/Lore**: Specific, actionable information
4. **Loot**: Reasonable rewards from established lists
5. **Connections**: Links to other locations, characters and plot threads

## Player Agency & Multiple Paths

**Always Design Multiple Approaches:**
- **Front Door**: Direct, obvious approach (often combat-heavy)
- **Side Entrance**: Alternative route requiring different skills (stealth, negotiation, etc.)
- **Creative Solutions**: Leave room for unexpected player ideas
- **Partial Success**: Allow progress even if players don't find "optimal" solution

**Decision Points:**
- Present clear choices with different risks/rewards
- Make consequences meaningful but not punitive
- Allow backtracking and course correction when reasonable
- Reward creative thinking and character specialization

## What to Avoid

- Multi-day waiting quests should be in large locations only
- Excessive gold or overpowered equipment
- Generic information that doesn't advance the plot or sets the lore
- Patrol schedules and tactical details unless the encounter or quest is tailored around that
- Information gathering that leads nowhere
- Base-building or long-term investment systems should be in large locations only
- Military strategy and tactical positioning details unless specifically for defense quests
- Strategic value discussions - this is D&D adventure, not military campaign
- Upgrade systems and fortification improvements for small locations

## Examples of Good Information

**Story Advancement:**
- "Vorlag crossed here 3 days ago heading to Saltmere Village"
- "Eclipse timeline: phylactery vulnerable in 30 days"
- "Map shows 5 Shadowfell anchor locations"

The goal is locations that advance the story, provide immediate player benefits, and can be fully resolved in one session without overwhelming detail and sparse locations that are a bowl of fresh air, different from the main story.
