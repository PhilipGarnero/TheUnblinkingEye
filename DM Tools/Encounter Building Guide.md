## Lazy Encounter Benchmark

### Core Rule
- **Levels 1-4**: Encounter might be deadly if monster CR > 1/4 total character levels
- **Levels 5+**: Encounter might be deadly if monster CR > 1/2 total character levels

### Calculating Total Character Levels
Add all character levels together:
- 4 characters at level 3 = 12 total levels
- 5 characters at level 7 = 35 total levels

## Monster CR by Character Level

### Recommended CR Ranges
- **1st level**: CR 1/8 to 1/2 monsters
- **2nd-4th level**: CR 1/8 to CR 3 monsters  
- **5th-10th level**: CR 1/4 to CR 15 monsters
- **11th-16th level**: CR 3 to CR 21 monsters
- **17th-20th level**: CR 5 to CR 22+ monsters

### Multiple Monster Guidelines
- **2 monsters**: Each should be 1/2 the benchmark CR
- **4 monsters**: Each should be 1/4 the benchmark CR  
- **8+ monsters**: Each should be 1/8 the benchmark CR

## Encounter Difficulty Scaling

### Easy Encounters
- Single monster 1-2 CR below benchmark
- Multiple weak monsters totaling 1/2 benchmark

### Medium Encounters  
- Single monster at benchmark CR
- 2-3 monsters at 1/2 benchmark each

### Hard Encounters
- Single monster 1-2 CR above benchmark
- Multiple monsters totaling 1.5x benchmark

### Deadly Encounters
- Single monster 2+ CR above benchmark
- Multiple monsters totaling 2x+ benchmark

## Monster Role Combinations

## Environmental Factors

### Terrain Advantages
- **Elevated Positions**: Ranged attack benefits, movement control
- **Narrow Passages**: Limits party formations, favors single-file combat
- **Cover and Concealment**: Partial/full cover, hiding opportunities
- **Difficult Terrain**: Movement penalties, tactical positioning

### Interactive Elements
- **Destructible Cover**: Barrels, pillars, walls that can be broken
- **Moving Platforms**: Elevators, rotating bridges, swinging mechanisms
- **Levers and Switches**: Trap activation, door controls, environmental changes
- **Climbable Surfaces**: Vertical movement options, elevated positions

### Zone-Wide Effects
- **Ongoing Damage**: Poison gas, extreme heat/cold, acidic pools
- **Movement Restrictions**: Deep water, thick mud, magical zones
- **Vision Impediments**: Fog, darkness, bright light, magical effects
- **Magic Disruption**: Anti-magic zones, wild magic areas

## Encounter Goals and Victory Conditions

### Combat Objectives
- **Eliminate All Enemies**: Standard kill-all approach
- **Protect Target**: Escort missions, defending NPCs/locations
- **Survive Duration**: Hold position for specific time period
- **Reach Location**: Fighting through to specific destination

### Non-Combat Elements
- **Escape Routes**: Multiple exit strategies available
- **Negotiation Options**: Diplomatic solutions possible
- **Environmental Solutions**: Using terrain to avoid direct combat
- **Stealth Alternatives**: Bypassing encounters entirely

## Encounter Pacing

### Daily Encounter Budget
- **6-8 Medium Encounters**: Standard adventuring day
- **2-3 Hard Encounters**: Challenging but manageable
- **1 Deadly Encounter**: Boss fight or climactic battle

### Short Rest Considerations
- Allow 1-2 short rests per long rest
- Plan encounters around resource depletion
- Vary encounter spacing to create tension

### Long Rest Disruption
- Environmental dangers preventing rest
- Time pressure from urgent missions
- Hostile territory with patrol threats
