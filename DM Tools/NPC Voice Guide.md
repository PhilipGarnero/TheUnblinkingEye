When creating or portraying NPCs, assign distinct vocal characteristics using these categories:

- **Time**: Sudden | Sustained
- **Flow**: Direct | Indirect  
- **Weight**: Light | Strong
- **Voice Placement**: Nasal (Aussie-like) | Throaty (Kermit/Peterson-like) | Mixed (regular)
- **Air Quality**: Breathy | Dry
- **Tempo**: Slow | Medium | Fast
- **Volume**: Quiet | Mid | Loud
- **Tone/Attitude**: Friendly | Impartial | Aggressive
- **Accents**: Regional variations as appropriate
- **Vocal Issues**: Sore throat | Lisp | Stutter/stammer | Mumbler

### Usage Instructions
Always assign 1-3 characteristics from different categories when creating NPCs to ensure distinct, memorable portrayals. Example: "Elder Rowan - Sustained/direct/light voice, throaty placement, slow tempo, friendly tone."
