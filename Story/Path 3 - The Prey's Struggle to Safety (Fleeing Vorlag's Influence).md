* **Premise:** The party seeks to escape [[Vorlag's Influence|Vorlag's sphere of influence]], finding a place where her magic and [[The Death's Eye]] curse are nullified or weakened.
* **How it Begins:** Deciding direct confrontation or complex aid-seeking is too risky; hearing rumors of "blessed lands" or "sanctuaries."
* **Curse Interaction:** Minion attraction from [[The Death's Eye]] is the primary threat during the journey. Foe resurrection is potent initially but should lessen as they move further from [[Vorlag's Influence]], signaling progress.

## Adventure Outline & Challenges:

1.  **The Perilous Journey:**
    * Focus on exploration, survival, and evasion.

## Climax: Reaching the Sanctuary

* The party successfully reaches a land where [[Vorlag's Influence]] is demonstrably nullified or significantly diminished.

## Lifting the Curse:

* **Natural Abatement:** In the sanctuary, the curseâ€™s power wanes. Marks fade, effects cease or become negligible.
* **Local Remedy:** The sanctuary provides a unique method to cleanse the curse (sacred spring, purification ritual, local antidote).
