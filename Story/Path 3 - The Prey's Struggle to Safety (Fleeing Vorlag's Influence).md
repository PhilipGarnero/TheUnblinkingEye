* **Premise:** The party seeks to escape [[Vorlag's Influence#Areas of Strong Influence|Vorlag's sphere of influence]], finding a place where her magic and [[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]] curse are nullified or weakened.
* **How it Begins:** Deciding direct confrontation or complex aid-seeking is too risky; hearing rumors of "blessed lands" or "sanctuaries."
* **Curse Interaction:** Minion attraction from [[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]] is the primary threat during the journey. Foe resurrection is potent initially but lessens as they move further from [[Vorlag's Influence#Areas of Strong Influence|Vorlag's Influence]], signaling progress.

## Adventure Outline & Challenges:

1.  **The Perilous Journey:**
    * Focus on exploration, survival, and evasion.
    * Cross vast wildernesses, treacherous terrains, or unstable territories throughout the [[Dalelands]]. Manage resources, find safe rests, evade pursuers.
    * The PCs use less-traveled, hidden routes to avoid Vorlag's main forces. These paths lead through ancient, forgotten forests like [[Direwood Forest]] and treacherous mountain passes near [[Dragon's Tooth Bum]]. They encounter Fey creatures twisted by the encroaching Shadowfell, who attempt to lure them off course or trap them in illusions. The PCs navigate natural hazards like rockslides, flash floods, and magically induced disorientation.
    * Finding the shadowed paths too perilous or slow, the PCs eventually join a large **caravan of refugees** fleeing Vorlag's advance. The journey is slow and fraught with internal conflict. Resources are scarce, disease spreads rapidly, and the caravan is a constant target for Vorlag's Cultists who infiltrate the group to sow despair and identify potential new undead. The PCs protect the caravan, manage internal disputes, and make difficult choices about who to save.

2.  **The Pursuit:**
    * Throughout their arduous journey, **[[Malachar Shadowbane#Basic Information|Malachar Shadowbane]]**, Vorlag's drow lieutenant, personally tracks the PCs. He appears at critical moments, always one step behind, leaving chilling messages or attacking their temporary shelters. He uses his knowledge of the [[Dalelands]] terrain and his drow abilities to ambush them, never engaging in a full, decisive battle until the PCs are weakened.
    * Compounding this, the Death's Eye curse leaves a faint, ethereal trail visible only to Vorlag's most powerful undead. Shadows and Wraiths follow this trail, appearing at night to drain the PCs' life force and report their location back to Vorlag. The PCs find a way to mask their magical signature or cleanse the trail to truly escape.

3.  **Discovering the Sanctuary:**
    * The PCs reach a hidden valley in the remote mountains beyond [[Harrowdale]], protected by an **ancient, self-sustaining magical ward, the Veil of Aethelgard**. This ward completely nullifies all necromantic magic within its boundaries. The Death's Eye curse immediately fades upon entry. However, the ward requires periodic maintenance, and its guardians, **The Stone Wardens of Aethelgard** (an order of Monks), demand the PCs assist in its upkeep, which involves dangerous expeditions outside the ward. This marks the end of the current campaign, as the PCs have found their sanctuary.
    * Alternatively, the PCs reach a bustling, fortified city that has successfully resisted Vorlag's influence, **Silverhaven** (located in [[Silverymoon]] or a similarly distant realm beyond the [[Dalelands]]). This city relies on a highly organized militia, strong community bonds, and a network of spies. The Death's Eye curse remains, but its effects are significantly weakened due to the sheer density of living energy and the city's active countermeasures. Silverhaven offers refuge, but demands the PCs contribute to its defense, perhaps by joining patrols. This also marks the end of the current campaign, as the PCs have found their sanctuary and a new purpose.

## Climax: Reaching the Sanctuary

* The party successfully reaches a land where [[Vorlag's Influence#Areas of Strong Influence|Vorlag's Influence]] is demonstrably nullified or significantly diminished.

## Lifting the Curse:

* **Natural Abatement:** In the sanctuary, the curseâ€™s power wanes. Marks fade, effects cease or become negligible.
* **Local Remedy:** The sanctuary provides a unique method to cleanse the curse (sacred spring, purification ritual, local antidote).
* **Contained but Present:** The curse isn't fully removed, but the sanctuary prevents harmful manifestations. Marks remain as a rem
