* **Premise:** The party seeks powerful individuals, ancient lore, or divine intervention to cleanse the curse.
* **How it Begins:** Consulting sages, priests, or loremasters for non-confrontational solutions.
* **Curse Interaction:** Journeys will be perilous due to minion attraction from [[The Death's Eye]]. Foe resurrection may occur if their search leads them into areas with [[Vorlag's Influence]] or if [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]] targets those trying to help them.

## Adventure Outline & Challenges:

1.  **The Quest for Knowledge:**
    * Travel to renowned libraries, wise hermits, or ancient temples.
    * Navigate treacherous routes, solve riddles, or perform services for knowledge guardians.
2.  **Securing an Audience/Ritual:**
    * **Expert Aid (Archmage/Wizard Conclave):**
        * May require rare spell components (e.g., celestial tear, powdered unicorn horn, Feywild bloom). Party quests for these items.
        * Could involve consulting [[Elara Meadowlight]] or similar experts.
    * **Divine Intervention (Temples/Holy Sites):**
        * Seek aid from deities like Lathander, Pelor, Kelemvor, Silvanus (Player's Handbook, p. 293ff).
        * May need to perform a great service: cleanse a desecrated site, recover a holy relic, protect the faithful.
        * Could involve [[Divine Servants (WIP)]] at major temples.
3.  **The Cleansing Ritual/Intervention:**
    * A powerful, potentially lengthy ritual is performed.
    * The party might need to defend the casters/site from a final assault by [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s forces who sense the curse being undone.

## Climax: The Ritual's Completion

* The ritual is successfully performed, or the chosen deity/entity grants its boon.

## Lifting the Curse:

* [[The Death's Eye]] marks are painfully but completely burned away by holy energy or arcane power.
* Characters are freed and may gain additional boons or a positive relationship with the entity that aided them.
