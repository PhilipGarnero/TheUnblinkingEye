# Session 1 - The Skeleton Attack

## Session Overview
The first session began with our party in the village of Stillwater Creek, where they chose to drink at Martha Ma's tavern instead of pursuing the initial quest hooks. The session culminated in a deadly skeleton attack orchestrated by Vorlag the Pale, resulting in casualties and the cursing of most party members.

## Key Events

### Pre-Attack Activities
- **Party's Choice**: Players ignored the two initial quest opportunities in Stillwater Village
- **Tavern Visit**: The party spent time drinking at Martha Ma's tavern

### The Skeleton Attack
- **Vorlag's Assault**: Vorlag the Pale attacked the village with skeletal forces
- **Heroic Response**: The party rushed out to save the children when the attack began
- **Casualties**: 
  - Brother Marcus was killed during the battle
  - One child also died despite rescue efforts
- **Allied Support**: The Order of the Gauntlet assisted in repelling the enemies
- **Near Death**: Thoric nearly died but was saved with a healing potion
- **The Cursing**: At the battle's end, all party members except Elunar were cursed by Vorlag with [[The Death's Eye]] (Witte Sisse was struck right in the face)

### Post-Battle Aftermath
- **Arrogance**: The party became cocky the next day
- **Conflict with Ser Gareth**: The party annoyed Ser Gareth so much that he broke a table in anger - he now hates them
- **Conflict with Martha Ma**: The party also annoyed Martha Ma by claiming they did all the work

### Recovery Mission
- **Holy Symbol Quest**: The party searched for and found Brother Marcus's holy symbol in the forest
- **Village Fortification**: Simultaneously, they brought back wood to help Thormgrim fortify the village (provided 1/3 of the help needed)

## Character Relations & Consequences

### Thormgrim
- **Status**: Positive relationship
- **Reason**: Didn't witness the conflict with Ser Gareth; impressed by the party's help with fortification
- **Reward**: Gave the party 50 gold pieces

### Ser Gareth
- **Status**: Mixed/Neutral to Hostile
- **Thoric**: Neutral relationship (thankful for help when he heard about it)
- **Others**: Dislikes the rest of the party due to their arrogance

### Martha Ma
- **Status**: Annoyed/Hostile
- **Reason**: Party's boastful attitude about their role in the battle

## Current Situation
- **Lyanna's Mission**: Lyanna went ahead to the Ancestor Mounds to avenge Brother Marcus
- **New Objective**: Ser Gareth has asked the party to prevent Lyanna from getting into danger

## Inventory Changes
- **Gained**: 50 gold pieces (from Thormgrim)
- **Gained**: Brother Marcus's holy symbol (recovered from forest)
- **Lost**: Various supplies/potions used during the battle (healing potion for Thoric)

## Session Consequences
1. **The Death's Eye Curse**: All party members except Elunar are now cursed
2. **Village Relations**: Mixed reputation - some grateful, others hostile
3. **New Quest Hook**: Must pursue and protect Lyanna at the Ancestor Mounds
4. **Resource Management**: Party has some gold but depleted healing supplies
5. **Character Development**: Party's arrogance has created social obstacles they must navigate
