## Premise

The characters find themselves in a settlement ([[Village of Stillwater Creek]]) that falls under attack by skeletal forces led by the necromancer [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]. During or immediately after the battle, Vorlag curses the player characters with the "[[The Death's Eye]]" for their interference or as part of a larger design. The campaign revolves around the characters' efforts to understand, survive, and ultimately lift this debilitating and dangerous curse.

## Inciting Incident: The Moonlit Raid on Stillwater Creek

1.  **The Setup:** The campaign begins in [[Village of Stillwater Creek]]. A chill wind picks up, dogs bark incessantly, then screams erupt from the village edge near the Ancestor Mounds or Direwood.
2.  **The Attack:**
    * **Skeletons** (Monster Manual, p. 272) emerge, attacking the village. For four Level 1 characters, initial waves might consist of 2-3 Skeletons, followed by a larger wave of 3-4.
        * *Statistics (Skeleton):* AC 13, HP 13 (2d8+4), Speed 30 ft., Vulnerable to Bludgeoning, Immune to Poison, Condition Immune to Exhaustion & Poisoned, Darkvision 60 ft. Attacks: Shortsword +4 to hit (1d6+2 piercing) or Shortbow +4 to hit (1d6+2 piercing).
3.  **Vorlag's Appearance:** As the PCs distinguish themselves, [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]] appears. She might be observing from a distance, or stride forth, perhaps with elite servants like [[Malachar Shadowbane (Drow Cultist)]] or [[Lysander Grimheart (The Betrayer Ghoul)]], or lesser undead like **Zombies** (Monster Manual, p. 316).
    * *Statistics (Zombie):* AC 8, HP 22 (3d8+9), Speed 20 ft., Immune to Poison, Condition Immune to Poisoned, Darkvision 60 ft. Undead Fortitude. Slam +3 to hit (1d6+1 bludgeoning).
    * *Statistics (Ghoul):* AC 12, HP 22 (5d8), Speed 30 ft., Immune to Poison, Condition Immune to Charmed, Exhaustion, Poisoned, Darkvision 60 ft. Attacks: Claws, Bite (can paralyze).
4.  **The Cursing:** Angered or dismissive, Vorlag "shoots" [[The Death's Eye]] at the PCs.
    * *Vorlag's Utterance (Example):* "Insolent mortals! You have dared to stand against the inevitable tide of undeath. For this, you shall bear my mark! Feel the chill of the grave cling to your very souls..."
    * Vorlag then makes her escape (e.g., via *Misty Step* or retreating with minions), not intending to be defeated at this stage.

## The Central Conflict

The characters must find a way to remove [[The Death's Eye]]. This curse not only has debilitating effects but also actively attracts [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s minions and can cause slain foes to rise as Skeletons in areas of her [[Vorlag's Influence|strong influence]]. Their quest will lead them down one of several potential paths:

- [[Path 1 - The Hunted's Hunt (Direct Confrontation)]]
- [[Path 2 - Seeking wisdom (Lift curse through help)]]  
- [[Path 3 - The Prey's Struggle to Safety (Fleeing Vorlag's Influence)]]
