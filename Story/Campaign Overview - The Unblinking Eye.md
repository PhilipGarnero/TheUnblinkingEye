## Premise

The characters find themselves in a settlement ([[Stillwater Creek - Village Index|Village of Stillwater Creek]]) located in [[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]] within the [[Dalelands]]. This peaceful village falls under attack by skeletal forces led by the necromancer [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]]. During or immediately after the battle, Vorlag curses the player characters with the "[[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]]" for their interference or as part of a larger design. The campaign revolves around the characters' efforts to understand, survive, and ultimately lift this debilitating and dangerous curse.

## Inciting Incident: The Dusk Raid on Stillwater Creek

1.  **The Setup:** The campaign begins in [[Stillwater Creek - Village Index|Village of Stillwater Creek]] in [[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]]. A chill wind picks up, dogs bark incessantly, then screams erupt from the village plaza as children spot skeletons. If the order of the gauntlet is here, [[Brother Marcus Dawnward#Basic Information|Brother Marcus Dawnward]] attempts to turn them but is killed right before by [[Malachar Shadowbane#Basic Information|Malachar Shadowbane]] who then disappears in darkness.
2.  **The Attack:**
    * **Skeletons** and **Zombies** emerge, overwhelming and attacking the village. For four Level 1 PCs, initial waves might consist of 2-3 enemies, followed by a larger wave of 3-4. If the order of the gauntlet is here, we can double ennemies and add a new wave.
3.  **Vorlag's Appearance:** As the PCs distinguish themselves, [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]] appears observing from a distance with elite servants [[Malachar Shadowbane#Basic Information|Malachar Shadowbane]] or [[Lysander Grimheart#Basic Information|Lysander Grimheart]].
4.  **The Cursing:** Vorlag is called by a minion and has to go.
	* Angered or dismissive, she shoots rays of dark magic : [[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]] at the PCs.
    * *Vorlag's Utterance (Example):* "Insolent mortals! You have dared to stand against the inevitable tide of undeath. For this, you shall bear my mark! Feel the chill of the grave cling to your very souls..."


## The Central Conflict

The characters must find a way to remove [[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]]. This curse not only has debilitating effects but also actively attracts [[Vorlag's Influence#Areas of Strong Influence|Vorlag's minions]] and can cause slain foes to rise as undeads in areas of her [[Vorlag's Influence#Areas of Strong Influence|strong influence]]. Their quest will lead them down one of several potential paths:

- [[Path 1 - The Hunted's Hunt (Direct Confrontation)]]
- [[Path 2 - Seeking wisdom (Lift curse through help)]]  
- [[Path 3 - The Prey's Struggle to Safety (Fleeing Vorlag's Influence)]]
