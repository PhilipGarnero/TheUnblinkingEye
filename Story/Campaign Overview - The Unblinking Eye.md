## Session Intro sentence
Contre toute attente, vos cœurs continuent de battre dans cette région tourmentée des Dalelands, mais la mort patiente dans chaque recoin sombre. Elle connaît vos noms, elle compte vos pas, et attend son heure avec une éternelle patience. Elle a pu observer ...

## Premise

The characters find themselves in a settlement ([[Village of Stillwater Creek]]) that falls under attack by skeletal forces led by the necromancer [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]. During or immediately after the battle, Vorlag curses the player characters with the "[[The Death's Eye]]" for their interference or as part of a larger design. The campaign revolves around the characters' efforts to understand, survive, and ultimately lift this debilitating and dangerous curse.

## Inciting Incident: The Dusk Raid on Stillwater Creek

1.  **The Setup:** The campaign begins in [[Village of Stillwater Creek]]. A chill wind picks up, dogs bark incessantly, then screams erupt from the village plaza as children spot skeletons. If the order of the gauntlet is here, [[Brother Marcus Dawnward]] attempts to turn them but is killed right before by [[Malachar Shadowbane]] who then disappears in darkness.
2.  **The Attack:**
    * **Skeletons** and **Zombies** emerge, overwhelming and attacking the village. For four Level 1 PCs, initial waves might consist of 2-3 enemies, followed by a larger wave of 3-4. If the order of the gauntlet is here, we can double ennemies and add a new wave.
3.  **Vorlag's Appearance:** As the PCs distinguish themselves, [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]] appears observing from a distance with elite servants [[Malachar Shadowbane]] or [[Lysander Grimheart]].
4.  **The Cursing:** Vorlag is called by a minion and has to go.
	* Angered or dismissive, she shoots rays of dark magic : [[The Death's Eye]] at the PCs.
    * *Vorlag's Utterance (Example):* "Insolent mortals! You have dared to stand against the inevitable tide of undeath. For this, you shall bear my mark! Feel the chill of the grave cling to your very souls..."


## The Central Conflict

The characters must find a way to remove [[The Death's Eye]]. This curse not only has debilitating effects but also actively attracts [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s minions and can cause slain foes to rise as undeads in areas of her [[Vorlag's Influence|strong influence]]. Their quest will lead them down one of several potential paths:

- [[Path 1 - The Hunted's Hunt (Direct Confrontation)]]
- [[Path 2 - Seeking wisdom (Lift curse through help)]]  
- [[Path 3 - The Prey's Struggle to Safety (Fleeing Vorlag's Influence)]]
