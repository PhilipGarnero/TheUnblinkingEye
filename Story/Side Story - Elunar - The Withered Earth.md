# Side Story: Elunar - The Echoes of the Elderwood

## Premise
Elunar, deeply connected to the land, feels [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]'s blight as a personal wound upon the earth. He discovers that the corruption isn't random but is specifically targeting the remnants of his lost druidic circle, the **Tel'Rethal**, to siphon power from their sacred sites. His personal quest is to cleanse these locations, an act that will restore his forgotten memories and unlock an ancient power known only to his clan.

## Inciting Incident
As the party travels, Elunar experiences sharp, painful visions of withering nature. One vision is overwhelmingly powerful: a magnificent, ancient tree, its leaves turning to ash and its bark cracking like dry earth. Though he doesn't recognize the location, he feels an undeniable, desperate pull towards it, as if a part of himself is dying with the tree. This is the first step on a journey into his forgotten past.

## Adventure Outline

### 1. The Sunken Grove of Tel'Rethal
Elunar's vision guides him to a once-lush grove in [[The Whispering Grove]] within [[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]], now a fetid, sunken swamp. The water is black and lifeless, polluted by a crude necromantic effigy at its center that pulses with dark energy.

*   **Challenge:** The grove is guarded by corrupted wildlife (e.g., [[Corrupted Giant Frog|Corrupted Giant Frogs]], [[Bone Hound|Bone Hounds]]) and the water itself seems to lash out. To cleanse the grove, Elunar must perform a purifying ritual that requires three rare **Moonpetal Blossoms**, which only grow in pure, untainted moonlight and can be found nearby with some effort.
*   **Memory Fragment:** Upon completing the ritual and destroying the effigy, the waters clear. As the moonlight touches the restored grove, Elunar receives a vivid memory fragment: he is a child, laughing as he learns to shape water with a kindly druid elder. He remembers the name of this place: **The Sunken Grove**.

### 2. The Ashen Path and the Desecrated Circle
The cleansed grove reveals a faint, glowing trail visible only to Elunar, leading him to a path of scorched earth through [[Direwood Forest]]. This "Ashen Path" cuts through the forest to a desecrated stone circle at [[The Singing Stones]], its druidic runes smeared with blood and overlaid with glowing, necromantic symbols that actively drain life from the surroundings.

*   **Challenge:** The path is patrolled by Vorlag's undead, such as a [[Grave Knight]]. At the circle itself, a [[Dusk Priest]] is performing a ritual to finalize the site's corruption. Elunar must disrupt the ritual without destroying the ancient stones, possibly by solving a puzzle to reverse the energy flow or by cleansing each rune individually while holding off the priest.
*   **Memory Fragment:** As he cleanses the final stone, Elunar recalls walking this path with his mentor, learning of the ley lines that converge here. He sees his own younger hands carving one of the druidic runes into the stone. He remembers his mentor's face and name.

### 3. The Heartwood - The Elderwood's Core
The ley lines in the restored circle now point Elunar toward the great tree from his vision in the heart of [[Direwood Forest]]. This is the **Heartwood**, the center of the ancient forest his clan protected for generations. He finds it twisted into a petrified nightmare, a conduit of necromantic energy. Guarding the tree is [[Malachar Shadowbane#Basic Information|Malachar Shadowbane]], a powerful necromancer who Elunar may vaguely recognize.

*   **Challenge:** [[Malachar Shadowbane#Basic Information|Malachar]] reveals he was a fellow druid of the Tel'Rethal. He tells Elunar that he willingly joined [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]], believing true power lies in the mastery of both life and death. He tempts Elunar with promises of power and the restoration of their clan through necromancy. The ensuing confrontation is a battle of ideology as much as magic.
*   **Memory Restoration:** Upon defeating [[Malachar Shadowbane#Basic Information|Malachar]], Elunar can finally lay his hands on the Heartwood. As he channels his energy into it, the corruption shatters, and his memories flood back completely. He remembers his life, his training, the attack by [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]'s forces that scattered his people, and the final lesson his mentor was about to teach himâ€”a legendary spell of restoration.

## Resolution
With his past reclaimed and his connection to the land fully restored, Elunar masters the ultimate spell of his druidic lineage. He now has a deeply personal reason to defeat [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]] and a powerful new tool to begin healing [[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]] and the broader [[Dalelands]].

*   **Legendary Reward - Heartwood's Revival:** Elunar learns a single, powerful legendary spell.
    *   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
    *   **Range:** Touch
    *   **Effect:** Elunar touches a point of natural earth (soil, a tree, a stone). Over the next 24 hours, a 1-mile radius around that point is cleansed of all magical and non-magical blight. Dead plants return to life, polluted water is purified, corrupted creatures are weakened (disadvantage on all rolls while in the area), and the land is consecrated against undead for one year. Once used, this spell cannot be cast again until the next solstice.
