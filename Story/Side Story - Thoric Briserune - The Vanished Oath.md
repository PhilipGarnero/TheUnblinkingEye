# Side Story: Thoric Briserune - The Vanished Oath

## Premise
Thoric Briserune, a paladin of Torm, is haunted by the inexplicable disappearance of his closest friend and fellow warrior, [[Lysander Grimheart#Basic Information|Lysander Grimheart]]. His quest is to uncover the truth behind Lysander's vanishing and, in doing so, understand the sinister forces at play, including [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]'s involvement.

## Inciting Incident
During the attack on [[Stillwater Creek - Village Index|Stillwater Creek]] in [[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]], Thoric witnesses a horrifying sight: a silhouette, bearing a striking resemblance to his vanished friend [[Lysander Grimheart#Basic Information|Lysander Grimheart]], fighting alongside [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]'s forces.

## Adventure Outline

1.  **Echoes of the Lost:** Thoric, driven by this horrific revelation, follows the trail of Vorlag's forces. This leads him to a site of a recent skirmish where Vorlag's undead clashed with local resistance fighters. Thoric finds clear evidence that the person resembling Lysander was present, and that its attacks were directed against the living.
    *   **Challenge:** The site is dangerous, possibly still patrolled by undead or scavenged by desperate survivors. Thoric must use his investigative skills and paladin abilities to piece together what happened.
    *   **Goal:** Thoric confirms that the person is indeed Lysander, twisted however, into an undead servant of Vorlag. He learns that Lysander was not simply taken, but transformed into a ghoul, and has been actively serving Vorlag, his former devotion to Torm now perverted into loyalty to the necromancer.

2.  **The Echoes of a Broken Past:** Thoric, seeking to understand the origins of the evil that corrupted [[Lysander Grimheart#Basic Information|Lysander]], encounters **Sister [[Elara Meadowlight#Basic Information|Elara]]**, a former cleric of Ilmater who knew Lovgar Sunstone ([[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]) during her time at the monastery. Sister Elara, now living as a reclusive healer in a small village in [[Mistledale]], reluctantly shares the tragic tale of Lovgar's abandonment, her suffering at the monastery, and her growing fascination with forbidden knowledge. Sister Elara recalls a kind paladin who would visit Lovgar, bringing her gifts and books, seemingly trying to offer her solace. Sister Elara reveals that Lovgar, consumed by resentment and the whispers of Shar, ultimately transformed into the malevolent necromancer known as [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]].
    *   **Challenge:** Sister Elara is wary and fearful of Vorlag, and convincing her to share the painful truth requires Thoric to demonstrate his unwavering faith and commitment to justice. The information itself is deeply disturbing, testing Thoric's resolve.
    *   **Goal:** Thoric uncovers the full, horrifying truth of Vorlag's origins, understanding the deep-seated resentment that fueled her transformation and the role a compassionate paladin played in her early life.

3.  **A Vision of Betrayal and Torment:** Armed with the knowledge of [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]'s past, Thoric seeks a way to understand [[Lysander Grimheart#Basic Information|Lysander]]'s fate. He finds an ancient **Scrying Pool** hidden in [[The Whispering Grove]] within [[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]], or consults a reclusive **Oracle of [[The Singing Stones]]**. Through a powerful ritual or a moment of divine insight, Thoric receives a vivid vision of Lysander's final encounter with Lovgar ([[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]). The vision reveals Lovgar's desperate confession of love, Lysander's gentle rejection, and her subsequent, vengeful ritual that transformed him into her ghoul servant, preserving just enough of his former self to torment him. The vision also reveals glimpses of Lysander's current suffering as Vorlag's ghoul, seeing his internal struggle and the chains of necromantic energy binding him. The vision also reveals a specific weakness in Lysander's corrupted form, or a ritual that can sever his connection to Vorlag.
    *   **Challenge:** The scrying or oracle's vision is emotionally harrowing, forcing Thoric to witness Lysander's agony and the betrayal. The process itself might attract unwanted attention from Vorlag's forces, or demand a sacrifice of Thoric's own energy or faith.
    *   **Goal:** Thoric gains the crucial insight into the method of Lysander's transformation and the nature of his torment, understanding the precise method required to grant his friend eternal rest. This knowledge solidifies Thoric's resolve for the final, merciful act.

4.  **The Final Mercy:** Thoric, with a heavy heart and newfound understanding, resolves to free his friend's spirit from [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]'s control. This leads him to a location where [[Lysander Grimheart#Basic Information|Lysander]] is actively serving Vorlag, perhaps guarding [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]] or a strategic position in [[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]].
    *   **Challenge:** Thoric confronts [[Lysander Grimheart#Basic Information|Lysander]], now a formidable and intelligent ghoul, a shadow of his former paladin self. Lysander fights with a twisted semblance of his old combat prowess, making the battle emotionally and physically taxing. [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]] may even be present, taunting Thoric or empowering Lysander.
    *   **Goal:** Thoric, using the knowledge gained from the scrying or oracle, defeats Lysander's corrupted form. As the ghoul falls, a faint, ethereal light, a remnant of Lysander's true spirit, rises from the body and ascends, finally finding peace. This act is a profound sacrifice for Thoric, but one that reaffirms his oath to Torm and his commitment to ending unholy corruption.

## Resolution
Thoric's quest culminates in a deeply personal and often tragic confrontation. Regardless of the outcome for [[Lysander Grimheart#Basic Information|Lysander]], Thoric gains a clearer understanding of [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]'s true power and the existential threat she poses. His faith is either reaffirmed and strengthened by his difficult choices, or irrevocably altered by the horrors he has witnessed. This side story provides Thoric with a powerful personal narrative that intertwines directly with the main campaign's themes of necromancy and corruption.
