* **Premise:** The party decides the only true way to be free is to eliminate [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]].
* **How it Begins:** Investigation into [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s activities at [[Village of Stillwater Creek]] and the Ancestor Mounds.
* **Curse Interaction:** High risk due to frequent operation near [[Vorlag's Influence]]. Minion attraction and foe resurrection from [[The Death's Eye]] will be common.

## Adventure Outline & Challenges:

1.  **Tracking the Shadow:**
    * Gather clues from the initial attack site (maps, artifacts, witness accounts).
    * **Quest 6: Tracking the Source** - Follow undead forces back to their staging area with ranger Lyanna Swiftarrow.
    * Discover the theft of **The Phalanx of Whispers** from the mounds and evidence of its transport. Learn that Vorlag seeks additional necromantic artifacts.
2.  **Unraveling the Conspiracy:**
    * **The Corrupted Ward Network:** Learn that [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]] stole the protective ward stones and corrupted them through necromantic rituals at the Ancestor Mounds.
    * Discover these corrupted stones now serve as **Shadowfell Anchors**, amplifying undead activity and thinning planar barriers across the region.
    * Investigate multiple ritual sites where additional ward stones are being prepared for corruption.
    * Involves dungeon crawls (ritual sites, cultist cells), research (deciphering necromantic symbols), and interrogations.
3.  **Gaining Strength and Allies:**
    * Undertake adventures to gain experience and disrupt [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s plans (liberating villages, sabotaging rituals, retrieving items she seeks).
    * Recruit allies who oppose [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]] (ranger conclaves, knightly orders, rival groups).
    * Characters should aim for level 5-7 before confronting [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]].
4.  **The Approach to [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s Sanctum:**
    * Learn the location of [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s main base (desecrated temple, catacombs, dark tower).
    * Plan the assault.

## Climax: Assault on Vorlag's Sanctum

* Fight through [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s toughest guardians (e.g., **Ghouls**, **Ghasts** (Monster Manual, p. 148), **Wights** (Monster Manual, p. 300)).
* Confront [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]] (CR 8, modified **Mage** stat block â€“ Monster Manual, p. 347).

## Lifting the Curse:

* Upon [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s defeat, the necromantic magic sustaining [[The Death's Eye]] unravels.
* The marks might burn intensely then fade.
* This could be immediate or require a minor ritual over her defeated form or an item she possessed.
