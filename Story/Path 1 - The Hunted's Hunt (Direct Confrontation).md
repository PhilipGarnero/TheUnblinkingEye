* **Premise:** The party eliminates Vorlag the Pale.
* **How it Begins:** Investigation into [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]]'s activities at [[Stillwater Creek - Village Index|Village of Stillwater Creek]] in [[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]] and [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]].
* **Curse Interaction:** High risk due to frequent operation near [[Vorlag's Influence#Areas of Strong Influence|Vorlag's Influence]]. Minion attraction and foe resurrection from [[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]] are common.

## Adventure Outline & Challenges:

1.  **Tracking the Shadow:**
    * Gather clues from the initial attack site (maps, artifacts, witness accounts).
    * **[[Village Quests#Quest 6: Tracking the Source|Quest 6: Tracking the Source]]** - Follow undead forces back to their staging area with ranger [[Lyanna Swiftarrow#Basic Information|Lyanna Swiftarrow]] through [[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]].
    * Discover the theft of [[Cursed Artifacts#The Phalanx of Whispers|The Phalanx of Whispers]] from the mounds and evidence of its transport. Learn that [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]] seeks additional necromantic artifacts.
    * Vorlag dispatches a **Bone Stalker**, a unique and intelligent undead tracker, that relentlessly pursues the PCs across the Dalelands. This creature employs hit-and-run tactics, targeting vulnerable party members and retreating when injured, only to return days later. Alongside the Bone Stalker, **Sorrow Wisps** are sent to drain the PCs' resolve, inflicting levels of exhaustion during long rests until defeated.
    * As the hunt intensifies, Vorlag uses **dominated villagers** as unwilling messengers. These unfortunate souls, their eyes vacant and voices hollow, approach the PCs in seemingly innocuous situations, delivering chilling prophecies about their impending doom or offering false leads that lure them into ambushes.

2.  **Unraveling the Conspiracy:**
    * **The Corrupted Ward Network:** Learn that [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]] stole the protective ward stones and corrupted them through necromantic rituals at [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]].
    * Discover these corrupted stones now serve as **Shadowfell Anchors**, amplifying undead activity and thinning planar barriers across the region.
    * Investigate multiple ritual sites where additional ward stones are being prepared for corruption.
    * Involves dungeon crawls (ritual sites, cultist cells), research (deciphering necromantic symbols), and interrogations.
    * The PCs discover ancient, forgotten prophecies in **[[The Lost Library of Archendale]]** in [[Archendale]]. These texts explicitly detail the [[The Dusk Lord#Basic Information|Dusk Lord]]'s original banishment and foretell his inevitable return, revealing that while Vorlag's defeat is crucial, it only delays, but does not prevent, the larger threat. The prophecies describe specific rituals required to permanently seal the planar rift.
    * After a specific milestone the players couldn't prevent (e.g., Vorlag completes a major ritual to empower her forces), the veil between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell tears. **Planar bleed-through** occurs in localized areas, manifesting as zones of despair and fear. Shadow Demons and Night Hags directly manifest into the [[Dalelands]] and they are now following Vorlag's orders.

3.  **Gaining Strength and Allies:**
    * Undertake adventures to gain experience and disrupt [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]]'s plans (liberating villages, sabotaging rituals, retrieving items she seeks).
    * Recruit allies who oppose [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]] (ranger conclaves, knightly orders, rival groups).
    * Characters aim for level 7 before confronting [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]].
    * A powerful entity contacts the PCs, offering aid against Vorlag. This entity is one of the following:
        *   **Kaelen, the Obsidian Hand's Master:** A ruthless bandit chief who sees Vorlag's expansion as a threat to his own dominion. He offers temporary control over his brigands in exchange for a share of Vorlag's spoils or the elimination of a rival.
        *   **Xylos, the Whispering Demon:** A minor demon lord seeking to destabilize the region for its own nefarious purposes. Xylos offers dark knowledge or temporary demonic power in exchange for the PCs performing a ritual that opens a minor portal to the Abyss.
        *   **The Wyrmspeaker's Envoy:** A representative of the Cult of the Dragon, who views Vorlag's necromancy as an affront to draconic power. They offer draconic artifacts or the aid of their cultists in exchange for the PCs retrieving a specific dragon egg or ancient draconic relic from Vorlag's possession.
    * The PCs find themselves in a situation where using a **powerful artifact, the Soul-Drinker's Blade**, is the only way to overcome a critical obstacle set by Vorlag. This artifact grants immense power only to those bearing the curse but slowly corrupts their souls, leaving a visible, physical mark of corruption on the PC with each use.

4.  **The Endgame:**
    * The final confrontation with Vorlag takes place within her personal sanctum, **The Necrotic Labyrinth**, a magically warped maze of bone and shadow. The lair itself is a living entity, constantly shifting and attacking the PCs with necrotic energy and animated constructs.
    * The PCs arrive at Vorlag's stronghold just as she begins a grand ritual to fully summon the Dusk Lord into the Material Plane. The climax is a desperate race against time: the PCs must navigate the Labyrinth, disrupt the ritual components, defeat Vorlag, and banish the nascent form of the Dusk Lord before the summoning is complete. Failure results in the Dusk Lord's full manifestation.
    * After Vorlag's defeat, the land itself remains blighted by her influence. The PCs undertake a final, arduous **cleansing ritual**, traveling to key corrupted sites (e.g., the Ancestor Mounds, the Whispering Grove) and performing specific rites, battling lingering pockets of necromantic energy and powerful undead remnants. Success restores the Vale.
    * Only after this cleansing, with the immediate threat seemingly dealt with, the PCs uncover a hidden map or decipher a coded message that reveals the precise location of the [[The Dusk Lord#Basic Information|Dusk Lord]]'s phylactery, **The Sun's Tomb**. This artifact is not in the [[Dalelands]] but in a distant, dangerous plane, and destroying it becomes the ultimate objective, a quest that transcends Vorlag's immediate threat, as the planes are now too weak and the Dusk Lord will come one way or another.
