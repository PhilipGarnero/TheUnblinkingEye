# Side Story: Yuyu - The Lost Kin

## Premise
Yuyu, an outlander halfling, carries the deep-seated longing to find his lost family, from whom he was separated as a child. His journey through the Dalelands is not just about surviving Vorlag's curse, but about searching for any sign of his kin.

## Inciting Incident
Yuyu's journey is driven by a childhood trauma:
His parents, fleeing a brutal attack on their home, managed to hide Yuyu in the forest just before they were caught and killed for resisting. Yuyu, the sole survivor, carries the deep-seated longing to understand *what happened* and to find any other lost kin.

At [[Stillwater Creek - Village Index|Stillwater Creek]] in [[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]], Yuyu speaks with **[[Village NPCs#Martha "Ma" Greenthistle & Pipkin "Pip" Solloway|Martha "Ma" Greenthistle]]**. She expresses concern about **[[Finzin Arnberry#Basic Information|Finzin Arnberry]]**, a halfling farmer whose farm across the river has become strangely quiet since the recent attacks. She mentions that Finzin usually brings his produce to market, but hasn't been seen, and there are unsettling rumors of strange occurrences near his farm. This piques Yuyu's interest, as Finzin is a halfling, and Yuyu hopes to find a connection to his own lost kin.

## Adventure Outline

1.  **Finzin's Farm and the First Clue:** Yuyu, driven by Martha's concern, investigates [[Finzin Arnberry#Basic Information|Finzin Arnberry]]'s farm at [[The Halfling's Farm#Overview|The Halfling's Farm]] across the river. He finds Finzin alive but shaken. However, as Yuyu (and the party) approaches, [[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|the Death's Eye]] curse activates, causing nearby dead animals and buried livestock on Finzin's farm to rise as undead. The PCs must fight these newly risen creatures while protecting Finzin.
    *   **Challenge:** The sudden appearance of undead on Finzin's property, triggered by the curse, creates an immediate combat encounter. Yuyu must protect Finzin while dealing with the threat.
    *   **Goal:** After the undead are dealt with, [[Finzin Arnberry#Basic Information|Finzin]] grateful for the rescue, is bewildered by the sudden appearance of the undead. He has no explanation for it, but he is deeply shaken. He provides Yuyu with a list of two halfling settlements and common trade routes. The first, **Oakhaven** (located in [[Featherdale]]), is a small, isolated community. The second is **Willow Creek** (in [[Mistledale]]).

2.  **The Ransacked Settlement (Oakhaven):** Yuyu and the party travel to Oakhaven in [[Featherdale]], the first settlement [[Finzin Arnberry#Basic Information|Finzin]] mentioned. They find it completely ransacked and deserted, with clear signs of a violent attack and no survivors. As they investigate the ruins, two opportunistic halfling bandits, remnants of the attack, attempt to ambush the party.
    *   **Challenge:** The discovery of the destroyed settlement is grim, and the sudden bandit ambush tests the party's readiness.
    *   **Goal:** After dealing with the halfling bandits, Yuyu finds a small, distinctive halfling trinket or a unique halfling-made tool, confirming that halflings were indeed here. The bandits, if interrogated, might offer vague information about the Merry Marauders being responsible for the destruction, or simply confirm that the settlement was cleared out by a larger section of their organized group. This grim discovery pushes Yuyu to continue his search towards Willow Creek.

3.  **The Marauder's Shadow in Willow Creek:** 
    *   Yuyu follows [[Finzin Arnberry#Basic Information|Finzin]]'s directions to a small, isolated halfling settlement called **Willow Creek** in [[Mistledale]]. Upon arrival, the halflings are wary but quickly recognize Yuyu as one of their own. An elder, **Granny Willowbrook**, approaches Yuyu, her face etched with worry. She explains that Willow Creek, and other nearby halfling communities throughout [[Mistledale]] and [[Featherdale]], are being terrorized by a ruthless halfling bandit gang known as the **[[Bandits#The Merry Marauders|Merry Marauders]]**, led by the infamous **"Blackfoot" Pete Greenhill**. The Marauders are systematically raiding settlements, not just for loot, but to force halflings into their ranks or drive them from their homes to expand their territory. Granny Willowbrook pleads with Yuyu and the party for help, offering what little the village has in exchange for protection. She mentions that the Marauders have a particularly cruel and cunning lieutenant, a halfling known only as **"The Shadow"**, who is unusually skilled and ruthless, and seems to hold a position of significant power within the gang.
        *   **Challenge:** The Merry Marauders are cunning and well-organized, using their knowledge of the terrain and halfling tactics to their advantage. Yuyu and the party must decide whether to directly confront the Marauders, attempt to infiltrate their ranks, or protect Willow Creek from an impending raid.
        *   **Goal:** Yuyu gains detailed information about the [[Bandits#The Merry Marauders|Merry Marauders]]' operations, their leader, and their brutal methods. He learns that they have been responsible for the displacement of many halfling families throughout the [[Dalelands]], and the chilling possibility that his own kin might have fallen victim to them, or even been been forced to join their ranks, becomes a stark reality. He also hears unsettling rumors about "The Shadow's" origins, hinting at a past similar to his own, and a strange familiarity in the descriptions.

4.  **The Bitter Truth and a Brother's Choice:** Yuyu and the party confront the [[Bandits#The Merry Marauders|Merry Marauders]], leading to a direct clash with "Blackfoot" Pete Greenhill and his lieutenants. During the confrontation, Yuyu comes face-to-face with "The Shadow" â€“ who is revealed to be his long-lost brother, **Kaelen**. Kaelen, kidnapped by the Marauders as a child and forced into servitude, has risen through their ranks, becoming a ruthless and respected figure. As Yuyu and Kaelen clash, "Blackfoot" Pete Greenhill mocks them, exposing the full, tragic story of Yuyu's family: how their parents died resisting the Marauders, barely managing to hide Yuyu, and how Kaelen was taken and molded into a weapon.
    *   **Challenge:** This is a deeply emotional and physically demanding encounter. Yuyu must confront his brother, who is now a formidable opponent, while dealing with the taunts of "Blackfoot" Pete Greenhill and the surrounding Marauders. Yuyu faces a profound moral dilemma: fight his own brother to the death, or attempt to appeal to the lost part of him.
    *   **Goal:** Yuyu has a choice: he can attempt to convince Kaelen to abandon the Marauders and reclaim his true self, or he can fight him. If Yuyu succeeds in convincing Kaelen, Kaelen might turn against "Blackfoot" Pete Greenhill, creating an internal conflict within the Marauders. If Yuyu fights and defeats Kaelen, it is a tragic victory, but one that frees his brother's spirit from the Marauders' influence.

## Resolution
Yuyu's quest culminates in a tragic but definitive understanding of his family's fate and a profound personal choice. The reunion he longed for is replaced by a grim resolve and a new purpose. Whether Kaelen is redeemed or falls, Yuyu finds a new purpose in protecting others from the same horrors, whether it be [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]'s relentless blight or the ruthless expansion of the [[Bandits#The Merry Marauders|Merry Marauders]]. His personal loss and the confrontation with his brother fuel his determination, transforming him from a lost kin into a fierce guardian of his people.
