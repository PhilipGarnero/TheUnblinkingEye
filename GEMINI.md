## Core Campaign Mechanics

### Campaign Tone
Dark fantasy with themes of curse, undeath, and the struggle against necromantic corruption. Players must balance survival, investigation, and the growing threat of their curse while seeking a cure through one of multiple paths.

### Additional rules
- Injuries on downed creatures : 1d4 for severity (handicap, hindrance, rest, cosmetic)
- Massive damage causes until next turn : nothing, loss of reaction, disadvantage on ability checks, prone, stunned or downed based on 1d6 in that order

### Important Campaign Notes
- Campaign begins in [[Stillwater Creek - Village Index|Village of Stillwater Creek]] during/after skeleton attack
- [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]] curses PCs with [[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]] as punishment for interference
- Multiple viable solutions allow player agency in approach

#### Three Main Story Paths
1. **Direct Confrontation**: Hunt down and defeat [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]] (high risk, high curse interaction)
2. **Seeking Wisdom**: Find magical/divine cure through experts and temples
3. **Sanctuary Flight**: Escape to lands beyond [[Vorlag's Influence#Overview|Vorlag's influence]]
