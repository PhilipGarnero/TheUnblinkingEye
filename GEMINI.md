## Core Campaign Mechanics

### Campaign Tone
Dark fantasy with themes of curse, undeath, and the struggle against necromantic corruption. Players must balance survival, investigation, and the growing threat of their curse while seeking a cure through one of multiple paths.

### Additional rules
- Injuries on downed creatures : 1d4 for severity (handicap, hindrance, rest, cosmetic)
- Massive damage causes until next turn : nothing, loss of reaction, disadvantage on ability checks, prone, stunned or downed based on 1d6 in that order
- Critical attack roll makes full damage on one of the two damage dices

### Important Campaign Notes
- Campaign begins in [[Village of Stillwater Creek]] during/after skeleton attack
- Vorlag curses PCs with [[The Death's Eye]] as punishment for interference
- Multiple viable solutions allow player agency in approach

#### Three Main Story Paths
1. **Direct Confrontation**: Hunt down and defeat Vorlag (high risk, high curse interaction)
2. **Seeking Wisdom**: Find magical/divine cure through experts and temples
3. **Sanctuary Flight**: Escape to lands beyond Vorlag's influence

## Content Creation Guidelines

### Priority Reference Order
1. **DM Tools** - Always check relevant guides first for formatting and standards
2. **Campaign Overview** - Understand the core premise before creating content
3. **Existing similar content** - Check existing monsters/NPCs/locations for consistency

### Writing Standards
- Maintain dark fantasy tone throughout all content
- Include mechanical details (stats, DCs, damage) where relevant
- Reference curse effects when appropriate to story context
- Use consistent naming conventions and formatting
- Link related content using [[bracket notation]]

### Content Consistency
- Most undead should reflect Vorlag's necromantic influence
- Locations should show signs of curse corruption where applicable
- NPCs should have clear motivations related to the curse or survival
