## The Phalanx of Whispers *(Stolen by Vorlag)*
*Wondrous item, uncommon (cursed)*

**Original Location**: [[The Ancestor Mounds]] (stolen by [[Vorlag the Pale]])

This jagged, blackened finger bone gleams with a cold, greasy light. It is unnaturally heavy and cold to the touch, and holding it for more than a few seconds fills a non-evil creature's mind with faint, overlapping whispers of fear and doubt. This is a relic of Zylkresk, a focus for his power to break the will of mortals. Vorlag has already claimed this artifact from the mounds, leaving behind only disturbed earth and necromantic corruption.
