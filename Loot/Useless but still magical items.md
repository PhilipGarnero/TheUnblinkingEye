### The Pouch of Exactly What You Need

This is a small, unassuming belt pouch made of soft, worn deerskin. It closes with a simple leather drawstring, and a single, intricately carved wooden bead is tied to one of the ends. It appears to be completely empty.

**Effect:** This pouch appears to be empty and cannot hold items placed within it; they simply fall through the bottom as if it weren't there.

However, once per day, a character can reach into the pouch and declare they are looking for a simple, mundane, non-magical item worth no more than 1 gold piece. The item must be something one might reasonably find in a well-stocked pantry, a messy junk drawer, or a forgotten corner of a workshop. The item then materializes in their hand.

The pouch can produce items such as:

- A single, slightly bent nail.
- A length of string, about 3 feet long.
- A piece of hard candy, slightly sticky.
- A "lost" button that doesn't quite match any of your clothes.
- A single, dry sheet of parchment.
- A sliver of soap.
- A chicken feather.

The pouch cannot create anything of significant value, complex mechanisms (like a key for a specific lock), weapons, or magical components. It produces the simple, forgotten trifles of everyday life.

**Flavor Text:** _"It's the perfect accessory for the adventurer who has everything, except for that one tiny, incredibly specific, and ultimately mundane thing they left at home."_


### The Goblin-Proof Coin Pouch

This small, greasy leather pouch is crudely stitched together with what looks like sinew. It's adorned with a single, crooked goblin tooth hanging from its drawstring. The inside smells faintly of stale cheese and damp fur.

**Effect:** Any coinage, gems, or other valuables placed inside this pouch become completely uninteresting to goblins. A goblin that sees the pouch will recognize it as belonging to one of their own and will not attempt to steal it or its contents, assuming it's filled with worthless goblin "treasures" like shiny rocks, bottle caps, or dead bugs.

This "magic" only works on goblins. Any other creature with a desire for wealth will try to snatch it just the same. Furthermore, a particularly clever goblin (a rare specimen, to be sure) might still try to take it if it sees a non-goblin placing obvious valuables inside.

**Flavor Text:** _"Its previous owner, a goblin named Gribblenob, was lauded by his clan for owning such a fine pouch. He was also consistently the poorest goblin in the warren, as no one ever bothered to rob him."_


### Ring of Water Walking (in the Rain)

**Effect:** While wearing this ring during a rainstorm, you can walk on the surface of any puddles created by the storm as if they were solid ground. It has no effect on larger bodies of water like ponds, lakes, or oceans.

**Flavor Text:** _"Never again suffer the indignity of a wet sock from an ill-judged step! All other water-related perils remain fully in effect."_


### Hat of Disguise Self (as Yourself)

**Effect:** When you don this hat, you can use an action to cast _Disguise Self_. However, the only disguise you can create is a perfect replica of yourself, but with a slightly different colored shirt.

**Flavor Text:** _"Behold! It is I... but in periwinkle!"_


### Ever-Damp Rags

**Effect:** This bundle of once-fine silk rags is perpetually, unpleasantly damp. No matter what you do, they cannot be dried. They are excellent for cleaning up spills, but leave a faint, musty odor on whatever they touch.

**Flavor Text:** _"For the adventurer who wants to be prepared for messes, but not so prepared that they remembered to actually dry their cleaning supplies."_


### Chime of Opening (Single Use)

**Effect:** This small, silver chime can be used to cast the _Knock_ spell. When you strike it, it emits a thunderous "KNOCK, KNOCK!" sound, audible from up to 300 feet away, and then the chime cracks and becomes useless. It does not, however, actually open the lock. It just announces your intent very, very loudly.

**Flavor Text:** _"It's less a key and more a very loud, one-time-use doorbell."_


### Boots of Untraceable Passage

**Effect:** When you walk on soft surfaces like mud or sand while wearing these boots, you leave no footprints. On any other surface, like stone or wood, they function as perfectly ordinary, albeit very clean, boots.

**Flavor Text:** _"The ultimate tool for the overly tidy adventurer who just hates tracking mud into the dungeon."_

### The Orator's Quill

This elegant goose feather quill has a sharpened, silvery nib that never seems to dull. It feels balanced and important in your hand, as if destined to write words that will change the course of history.

**Effect:** When you use this quill to write, it perfectly transcribes your spoken words into beautiful, flowing script. The quill's magic, however, is indiscriminately literal. It writes down _everything_ you say while you are composing, including any stammers, coughs, muttered curses, or shouted interruptions. The final document will be an elegant, but painfully unabridged, record of your entire monologue.

**Flavor Text:** _"It's the perfect tool for writing a powerful speech, provided your first draft doesn't include, 'Gods, I'm hungry,' or, 'Is that a bug on the ceiling?'"_


### Amulet of Reptile Aversion

This is a simple clay medallion strung on a leather cord. It's been fired with the vague shape of a lizard crossed out with a large 'X'. It feels cool to the touch.

**Effect:** While you are wearing this amulet, common, non-monstrous reptiles of Tiny size (such as geckos, small garden snakes, and skinks) find your presence instinctively unsettling. They will not willingly move into your space and will try to maintain a distance of at least 5 feet from you. This has absolutely no effect on larger or monstrous reptilian creatures like Kobolds, Lizardfolk, Crocodiles, Wyverns, or Dragons.

**Flavor Text:** _"Guaranteed to keep your campsite free of curious lizards. For the dragon, you may require a different, more comprehensive plan."_
