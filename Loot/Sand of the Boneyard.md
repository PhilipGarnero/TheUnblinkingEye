This is the perfect magical item for [[Elunar (JB)]]

### Part 1: The Discovery in the Crypt

The party discovers a side chamber in the crypt that has been converted into a crude but functional arcane workshop. In the center of the room is a large, enchanted circle, littered with half-assembled skeletons and piles of discarded bones. It's clear this is where the necromancer's primary work of animating the dead takes place.

To the side is a smaller desk where the subordinate, a "dusk priest," clearly spent his time. It's messy, covered in alchemical stains and discarded notes. One open journal contains the relevant entry, left behind in a hurry. Next to it sits a simple leather pouch filled with twitching, rattling bone fragments.

#### **The Dusk Priest's Journal**
_(The script is sharp, arrogant, and filled with notations of complaint)_

> **Entry 19.**
> 
> The Master remains silent. Days I have waited here in this damp, gods-forsaken hole for new instructions. The primary animation matrix is stable, the bone-tithe is sufficient... and I am left with nothing to do but watch the dust settle on the dust.
> 
> My boredom has led me to contemplate the Master's own work. Her "design" is so brutishly simple: force a soul-remnant into a vessel of bone and give it orders. There is no elegance. The principle of magical reassembly has far greater potential. What if the vessel could repair itself?
> 
> I have made progress. Applying a recursive matrix to a pouch of common stone was a fool's errand. But using the bone-shards from the Master's own failed specimens... now _that_ has yielded results! The pouch refills itself. The bones within knit back together from nothing. It is a perfect, self-sustaining supply of raw material.
> 
> The potential is enormous! An endless supply of arrowheads, dagger-shards, or... well, for now, just bones. The final step—imbuing the contents with will—still eludes me. But the replication engine is a success. A minor, amusing discovery. Perhaps I will show the Master when he returns, if only to prove my time has not been entirely wasted.

### Part 2: The Druidic Connection

The priest, focused on control and animation, completely missed the true potential. Here's how the druid connects the dots:

- **On a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check:** The druid deciphers the priest's jargon. "Recursive matrix," "replication engine"—they understand this is a powerful enchantment that creates a template for infinite magical replenishment. They see that the pouch of bone fragments on the table is the successful experiment mentioned in the notes.
- **On a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check:** The druid understands the priest's flawed perspective. The priest saw the bones only as raw material for weapons or undead minions. The druid, however, sees bone as a natural element—the final stage of a creature's life, a repository of its time on earth, and the mineral foundation of the soil. They realize the "will" the priest was trying to impart was a violation. The true power lies in honoring the nature of the components.

**The "Aha!" Moment:** The druid holds the priest's pouch of self-replicating bones. The Arcana check revealed _how_ it works, and the Insight check revealed _why_ it could be so much more. The druid realizes: "I don't need to force a will upon these bones. The bones are part of the cycle of life and death, of growth and decay. I can use my own magic to strip away the necromantic taint and bind the pouch to this natural cycle, turning it from a simple component bag into a conduit for the earth itself."

### Part 3: The Ritual in the Crypt

The druid can now adapt the priest's work. They will take the successfully enchanted pouch of bones and re-attune it from a tool of necromancy to an item of nature.

**Components:**

1. **The Dusk Priest's Pouch:** The existing, successfully enchanted pouch that refills with bone fragments.
2. **A Symbol of Life:** Something the druid can find in or near the crypt. This could be a patch of phosphorescent moss growing on a damp wall, a handful of rich grave soil, or water from a pure, underground spring.
3. **A Symbol of Death:** The bone fragments already in the pouch serve this purpose perfectly.
4. **The expenditure of one 2nd-level spell slot** to power the re-attunement ritual.

**The Process:**

The ritual can be performed anywhere in the crypt where the druid can find a quiet moment.

1. **Purification:** The druid opens the pouch and empties the bone fragments onto the stone floor. They place their symbol of life (the moss or grave soil) next to the bones.
2. **Meditation:** The druid must meditate for 10 minutes, focusing on the fundamental truth that life and death are not opposites, but two parts of the same cycle. They feel the stillness of the crypt, the life in the moss, the history in the bones.
3. **The Re-Binding:** The druid expends a 2nd-level spell slot, casting a spell like _Spike Growth_ or _Moonbeam_. They channel the spell's power not to harm, but to cleanse. The raw druidic magic washes over the pouch and the bones, overwriting the lingering necromantic energies. They are not commanding the bones to serve, but are asking the natural cycle of decay and rebirth to inhabit the pouch.
4. **Completion:** The bones on the floor will lose their foul, necromantic taint, appearing clean and white. They will then flow like dry sand back into the pouch. The pouch will feel different—not cold with the energy of undeath, but cool and solid, like deep earth. The druid has successfully repurposed the necromancer's tool and created the _Sands of the Boneyard_.
