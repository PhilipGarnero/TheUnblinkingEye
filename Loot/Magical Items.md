# Magical Items

## Erlan's Unbendable Resolve
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

**Location**: Hidden within [[The Ancestor Mounds]]

This humble-looking charm is a smooth, grey river stone, worn flat over centuries, and bound in a loop of petrified ironwood root. It feels warm to the touch and radiates a faint sense of calm and courage. It was Erlan's personal focus, a connection to the enduring life of the Dalelands that he used to remind him his resolve against Zylkresk's terror.

**Power (for the Adventurers):**
The charm has 3 charges. As an action, you can present the charm and expend 1 charge to create a wave of positive energy in a 15-foot cone. Each undead creature in that cone must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the charm's connection to Erlan's spirit is exhausted, and not returning the stone to his grave gives you 1 exhaustion status.

On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 radiant damage and is turned for 1 minute or until it takes more damage. On a successful save, the creature only takes 1d6 radiant damage.
The charm regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Swarm-Speaker's Spear
_Weapon (spear), uncommon (requires attunement)_

The shaft of this spear is made of pale, smooth wood that is always warm to the touch. The spearhead is a piece of obsidian that seems to absorb the light around it. When you focus on it, you can see the faint, spectral forms of insects swirling within the stone.

- **Swarm Sense:** As an action, you can send your consciousness into your swarm. You can move your swarm up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. For the next minute (or until you use a bonus action to end it), you can see and hear through your swarm's location. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
- **Flowing Swarm:** When you use your Gathered Swarm feature to move yourself 5 feet, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.


## Hornet's Sting
_Weapon (rapier), uncommon (requires attunement)_

The blade of this rapier is fashioned from the iridescent, stinger of a giant hornet, and its hilt is made from a piece of petrified hive. The weapon emits a low, almost inaudible buzz when it is unsheathed.

- **Agonizing Injection:** When you choose the damage option for your Gathered Swarm feature after hitting a creature with this weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Sling of the Grasping Swarm
_Weapon (sling), uncommon_

This sling is woven from durable jungle vines, but its pouch is made of a strange, chitinous material that appears to be composed of thousands of iridescent insect wings. When you swing it, it moves through the air in perfect silence.

**Property:**

- **Clinging Swarm:** When you hit a creature with an attack using this sling, you can have your swarm cling to the target. The first time the creature makes an attack roll before the start of your next turn, it has disadvantage on the roll. This effect can be used once per turn.

## Wraps of the Coiling Dragon
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a monk)_

These are a pair of silken hand-and-foot wraps, dyed a deep burgundy and embroidered with images of a dragon chasing its own tail. The fabric feels impossibly smooth.

- **Coiling Dragon Attack.** When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the unarmed strikes to have the wraps lash out at your target. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (against your Ki save DC) or become grappled. Until this grapple ends, the magical wraps animate and maintain the hold on the target, leaving your hands free to make attacks. The grapple ends if the target escapes (by winning a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your Ki save DC), if you move more than 5 feet away from the target, or if you use this ability to grapple a different creature.
- **Tipsy Sweep.** If a creature grappled by the wraps fails its check to escape, you can use your reaction to unbalance them, knocking them prone.

## Satchel of the Fire-Gut
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a monk)_

This small, embroidered satchel is made of fire-lizard hide and always remains warm. It contains what appear to be hard, nut-like kernels. The satchel holds a maximum of 3 kernels.

As a bonus action, you can chew and swallow one of the kernels. The kernel dissolves into a searing heat in your belly that lasts for 1 minute. While this effect is active, you gain the following benefits:

- You are resistant to cold damage.
- You can use your action to unleash the searing energy in a fiery belch. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki save DC. A creature takes fire damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. Using this property ends the effects of the kernel immediately.

On a scorched note inside, you can find the following recipe :

### **Recipe for Fire-Gut Kernels**

"The mountain provides the heat, the earth provides the seed, and the spirit provides the fire. Do not seek the grand and impossible when the small and potent lie at your feet. A wise monk knows how to draw strength from their surroundings."

**Yields:** 1d4 Fire-Gut Kernels
**Preparation Time:** 1 hour
**Required Tools:** Herbalism Kit or Alchemist's Supplies

#### **Ingredients:**

_All of these ingredients can typically be gathered in a single day in the foothills of a volcanic mountain or in a region with high geothermal activity._

- **One Ember Root.** This gnarled, reddish root grows from a low, thorny bush that thrives in warm, sulfurous soil. The root itself is warm to the touch.
- **The Glowing Glands of Three Fire Beetles.** These common insects store potent heat in a pair of glands on their abdomen. They must be harvested carefully.
- **A Dollop of Ash-Willow Sap.** The Ash-Willow is a stunted, hardy tree with pale bark that weeps a thick, sticky, greyish sap. The sap is an excellent binding agent.
- **A Pinch of Crushed clear lava stone.** This crystalline rock, often found in lava tubes and igneous deposits, captures the heat of the sun. It must be ground into a fine powder.
- **A Flask of Strong Alcohol.** Any potent spirit will do. It is needed to quench the kernel and seal its inner fire.

This entire process requires focus and a steady hand. At the end of the hour, you must make a **DC 15 Wisdom (Herbalism Kit) check**. On a success, you create 1d4 Fire-Gut Kernels. On a failure, the ingredients were improperly mixed, and the resulting kernels are inert and non-magical.

## Beads of the Iron Liver
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

This is a bracelet made of 3 polished, iron-colored beads. When you consume a serving of alcohol as a bonus action or part of an action, you can cause one of the beads to glow with a warm orange light for 1 hour.

- **Fortified Spirit.** While at least one bead is glowing, you become proficient in persuasion. While two are glowing,  you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. While three are glowing you are happy and have +1 to all Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and most Ability Check.
- **Purifying Gulp.** As a bonus action, if all the beads are charged, you can touch the beads to release their magic. Your body transforms the alcohol in your veins into life energy and you become sober. For 1 minute, you gain 1d8 temporary HP per turn but you have disadvantage on dexterity and wisdom saving throws and lose half your movement speed as you're now processing the impurities.


## Claws of the Sand-Burrower
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

These are a pair of heavy leather bracers, to which are affixed long, sharp claws carved from black obsidian. They feel gritty to the touch.

- **Sand Swimmer.** While wearing these bracers, you gain a burrowing speed of 20 feet. You can use this speed to move through sand, ash, and loose earth, but not solid rock.
- **Ambusher's Sense.** While you are burrowing underground, you have tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet, allowing you to detect the location of creatures on the surface. If you emerge from burrowing to attack a creature that was unaware of your presence, your first melee attack has advantage.

## Axe of the Unflinching Duty
_Weapon (battleaxe or waraxe), uncommon_

This dwarven battleaxe has a single, keen edge and a heavy, weighted back. The haft is wrapped in worn leather, and the head is etched with the dwarven rune for "duty."

- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- **Unflinching Resolve.** While you are conscious, you and allies within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. You must be holding the axe to grant this benefit.

## Gauntlet of the Loyal Hand
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

This single steel gauntlet is surprisingly light, designed to be worn on one hand while leaving it free enough to wield a weapon. It serves as a holy symbol for Torm.

- **Selfless Intervention.** When a creature you can see within 30 feet would be reduced to 0 hit points by an attack, you can use your reaction to have them drop to 1 hit point instead. This act of devotion comes at a great price; you immediately take force damage equal to the **full amount of damage** dealt by the triggering attack. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Helm of the Implacable Hunter
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

A rugged, dwarf-forged helm of iron and steel, with a visor shaped like a stylized scowl. It is unadorned, valuing function over form.

- **Hunter's Focus.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track the specific creature you have designated as the target of your Vow of Enmity.
- **Relentless Step.** While you are moving on your turn, your speed increases by 10 feet if you end that move closer to the target of your Vow of Enmity than where you started.
