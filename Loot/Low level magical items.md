### Flint of the Sure-Strike

This is a sharp, black piece of flint, cool to the touch. When you run your thumb along its edge, it doesn't cut you, but you feel a brief, static-like tingle.

**Effect:** This is a single-use consumable item. Before you make an attack roll with a weapon, you can use a bonus action to scrape this flint against the weapon. The next weapon attack you make before the end of your turn automatically hits its target, as if you had rolled a natural 20. This does not grant you a critical hit; it simply ensures the attack connects. After being used, the flint crumbles into a fine, inert powder.

**Flavor Text:** _"Sometimes, you just need to make sure one shot counts. This helps."_

### The Shepherd's Skin

This is a simple, sturdy waterskin made from goat hide and capped with a wooden stopper. The leather is etched with pastoral scenes of sheep grazing peacefully. The water inside always tastes remarkably pure and cool.

**Effect:** Any non-magical water stored in this waterskin is purified and rendered safe to drink within one minute. Furthermore, once per day, you can speak a command word ("Graze" in Common) to cause the canteen to slowly fill with up to one gallon of clean, fresh water over the course of 10 minutes.

**Flavor Text:** _"It's said the first shepherd to own one of these never lost a lamb to thirst. It won't save you from a dragon, but it'll make the walk to its lair a lot more pleasant."_

### The Sentry's Stone

This is a smooth, palm-sized river stone, flat on one side. A simple, open eye has been painted on it. When held, it feels completely inert, but you notice it seems to hum very faintly when certain creatures are discussed.

**Effect:** This stone is keyed to a specific creature type, chosen when the item is created (e.g., Goblins, Undead, Beasts, or Orcs). While the stone is on your person, it will grow noticeably warm if one or more creatures of that specific type move within 30 feet of you. It does not reveal their location or number, only their presence, and it will not react to creatures of any other type.

**Flavor Text:** _"A goblin-warden invented the first of these. It didn't stop the goblins from attacking, but it did stop them from sneaking up on him while he was on watch, which he considered a great success."_

### The Ventriloquist's Locket

This is an old silver locket, tarnished with age. It doesn't open easily, and instead of a space for a portrait, its interior is a swirl of polished, silent metal.

**Effect:** This locket can capture and release sounds.

- **Capture:** As an action, you can open the locket to capture a single, discrete sound that you can hear within 30 feet of you (a spoken word, a dog's bark, the clang of a hammer, a cough). The locket magically contains the sound, and the source of the sound becomes muted for that instant. The locket can only hold one sound at a time.
- **Release:** As an action, you can open the locket and release the captured sound. The sound emanates from a point of your choosing that you can see within 60 feet.

**Flavor Text:** _"A perfect gift for the practical joker, the aspiring spy, or the bard who needs their own sound effects."_

### The Skimmer Stone

This is a perfectly flat, circular stone disc, about the size of a dinner plate. It is surprisingly light and is covered in swirling, wave-like carvings.

**Effect:** As an action, you can throw this stone onto the surface of any liquid. Where it lands, it creates a hovering, circular platform of solid, translucent force that is 5 feet in diameter. The platform lasts for 1 minute before vanishing, at which point the stone falls into the liquid. The platform is stationary and can hold up to 500 pounds. After the stone has been used, it must be retrieved and allowed to dry for 10 minutes before its magic recharges.

**Tactical Uses:**

- **Bridge Building:** Create a series of stepping stones to cross a river, acid pit, or chasm filled with mud.
- **Combat Platforms:** Create a stable island to fight from in a flooded room or swamp, giving you solid ground where enemies might have none.
- **Reaching New Heights:** Use it to create a step up to a ledge that is just out of reach.
- **Saving Allies:** Throw it next to an ally who has fallen into water to give them a platform to climb onto.

**Flavor Text:** _"The gnomes who invented it lost the first three prototypes because they kept forgetting to attach a string."_
