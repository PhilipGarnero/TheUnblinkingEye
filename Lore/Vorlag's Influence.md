## Areas of Strong Influence

These are locations where the effects of [[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]], particularly the **Foe Resurrection** ability, are most potent. They include:
* Vorlag's lairs or workshops.
* Sites where he has recently performed significant necromantic rituals.
* Areas with desecrated shrines or graveyards under his control.
* Locations where his more powerful lieutenants are stationed.
* The immediate vicinity of Vorlag himself.

## Methods of Spreading Influence

* **Creating Undead:** Vorlag actively animates the dead, bolstering her forces with **Skeletons**, **Zombies**, and more powerful undead as her power grows. (Monster Manual, various pages).
* **Cults:** She may cultivate small cells of living followers (use **Cultist** and **Cult Fanatic** stat blocks, Monster Manual, p. 345 & p. 345) who are promised power or are simply enthralled by her. These cultists help her acquire resources, spread her dogma, and perform lesser tasks.
* **Desecration:** Corrupting natural areas, graveyards, and holy sites to create a blight that empowers her magic and demoralizes local populations.
* **Fear and Domination:** Using her undead forces to terrorize communities into submission, allowing her to operate more freely.

## Long-Term Goals

**The Dusk Lord's Return:** Vorlag's overarching mission is to facilitate her master's return from the Shadowfell to reclaim dominion over the Dalelands. This requires:

* **Establishing Shadowfell Anchors:** Creating permanent necromantic strongholds that thin the planar barriers
* **Regional Corruption:** Spreading undeath and despair across the Dalelands to make the region more hospitable to the Dusk Lord's influence
* **Army Building:** Amassing undead forces to serve as the Dusk Lord's initial army upon his return
* **Eliminating Opposition:** Neutralizing local temples, militias, and other forces that could resist the Dusk Lord's resurgence
* **Artifact Recovery:** Seeking items once owned by the Dusk Lord or other powerful necromantic relics that could aid in the summoning. Has already claimed [[Magical Items#The Phalanx of Whispers|The Phalanx of Whispers]] from [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]]

**Personal Ambitions:** Vorlag also seeks to prove herself worthy of greater power from her master, potentially earning lichdom as a reward for her successful service.
