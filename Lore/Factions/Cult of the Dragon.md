## Goals and Ambitions

### **The Sunstone of Renewal - Corruption Project**
The cult has successfully recovered the **Sunstone of Renewal** from the destroyed Lathander temple. They now work to corrupt this sacred relic by infusing it with the blood of a gold dragon through dark rituals. Their ultimate goal is to use the corrupted stone to create a **"Sun Dragon"** - a terrifyingly powerful and unnaturally born chromatic dragon that radiates destructive, scorching light. This would be a perversion of Lathander's domain of birth and renewal, creating the ultimate dracolich capable of both life magic and undeath.

### **Immediate Objectives**
- **Sunstone Corruption** - Complete the dark ritual to corrupt the Sunstone of Renewal
- **Gold Dragon Blood** - Acquire the blood of a gold dragon for the corruption ritual
- **Regional Stability** - Maintain enough order to continue operations
- **Information Dominance** - Expand spy networks and intelligence gathering
- **Resource Accumulation** - Build wealth to attract potential dragon allies
- **Recruitment Expansion** - Grow cult membership among desperate populations

### **Long-term Plans**
- **Dragon Alliance** - Convince a living dragon to undergo dracolich transformation
- **Regional Control** - Establish cult dominion over key Dalelands territories
- **Dracolich Awakening** - Resurrect or summon ancient dracolich masters
- **Draconic Empire** - Create a realm ruled by undead dragons

## Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities

### **Organizational Weaknesses**
- **Secretive Nature** - Limited coordination between distant cells
- **Internal Conflicts** - Competition between different cult factions
- **Dragon Dependence** - Vulnerable when lacking actual dragon leadership
- **Infiltration Risk** - Secretive recruitment makes them vulnerable to spies

### **Practical Limitations**
- **Resource Constraints** - Maintaining treasure hoards limits operational flexibility
- **Public Opposition** - Must hide true nature from general population
- **Magical Vulnerability** - Cult magic tied to draconic sources that can be disrupted
- **Leadership Gaps** - Difficulty replacing lost high-ranking members

## Notable Cult Sites

### **Shadowdale Operations**
- **The Old Sanctum** - Hidden temple beneath Shadowdale ruins
- **Dragon's Rest Tavern** - Front operation serving as recruitment center
- **Scale Warehouse** - Storage facility for cult resources and artifacts

### **Regional Strongholds**
- **Thornbridge Toll House** - Fortified position controlling river crossing
- **Goldbrook Mine Complex** - Underground facility with hidden ritual chambers
- **Traveling Shrines** - Mobile cult operations disguised as merchant caravans

The Cult of the Dragon represents a patient, long-term threat that operates through manipulation and hidden influence rather than direct confrontation. Their presence in the Dalelands adds another layer of complexity to the region's political landscape, as they work to maintain enough stability to continue their operations while preparing for their ultimate goal of draconic supremacy.
