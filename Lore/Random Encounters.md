- **Equipment**: Longbow, studded leather, ranger's badge

**The Dilemma:**
Kael captured a young orc scout (Grosh) from a tribe that's been raiding settlements. However, the orc claims his tribe is fleeing from "the pale death-bringer" and only raids out of desperation for food and shelter.

- **Gather Evidence**: Investigate Grosh's claims about undead activity
