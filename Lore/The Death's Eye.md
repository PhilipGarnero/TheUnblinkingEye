This curse is inflicted by [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]] when she doesn't have time to deal with the adventurers directly but wishes to punish their interference or mark them for her attention.

### The Curse Symbol
- **Death's Eye Mark:** ![Death's Eye](../Assets/Death%20eye.png)

## Nature of the Curse

The Death's Eye is a necromantic tether that binds the characters' spirits to the grave's cold embrace. It's a beacon for all the necrotic energy and undead in the area attracting unwelcome attention. Vorlag "shoots" this mark at the characters.

## Visual Sign

A faint, greyish, eye-like circle spreads from a point on each character's body (e.g., forearm, neck, chest), slowly becoming more vivid over time if not dealt with. It feels unnaturally cold to the touch.

## Core Mechanical Effects

1.  **Minion Attraction:** The mark acts like a beacon for Vorlag's minions or other undead creatures. In areas where Vorlag has influence or where undead are prevalent, characters with the mark are more likely to attract hostile attention. This can manifest as more frequent random encounters, or specific creatures seeking them out.
2.  **Foe Resurrection (in areas of Vorlag's strong influence):** When the party defeats enemies (especially humanoids) in an area with Vorlag's strong influence (e.g., near his lairs, sites of his rituals, or if one of his more powerful servants is present), there is a chance that slain foes will reanimate as **Skeletons** (Monster Manual, p. 272) a few rounds after their death. This encourages tactical disposal of bodies or rapid departure from battle sites.

## Additional Potential Effects (DM to choose or introduce as curse worsens)

* **Whispers from Beyond:** The character suffers from unsettling whispers and visions, especially during rest. They might have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing and/or require an extra hour of sleep during a long rest to avoid gaining a level of exhaustion.
* **Necrotic Frailty:** The character has vulnerability to necrotic damage. (Use with caution at low levels).
* **Mark of the Damned (Social/Roleplaying):** Animals become uneasy in their presence (disadvantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks). Some devout NPCs might react with fear or suspicion. Undead creatures of low intelligence (Skeletons, Zombies) might ignore the character unless attacked, while more intelligent undead might show a disturbing interest or attempt to command them.

## Progression

If the curse is not addressed, its effects can worsen over time:
* The visual mark becomes more prominent and painful.
* Disadvantage on death saving throws.
* Failure to regain all Hit Dice on a long rest.
