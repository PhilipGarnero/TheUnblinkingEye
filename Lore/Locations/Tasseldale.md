# Tasseldale - Wealthy Dale Under Siege

**Population:** 18,000 (wealthy trading dale)  
**Status:** Struggling Dale - Active undead threat forcing evacuations from farms and villages to bigger cities like Tegal's Mark  
**Capital:** Tegal's Mark (fortified trading city)

## Regional Description

Once the wealthiest of the smaller dales, Tasseldale's prosperity came from its strategic position along major trade routes and its skilled craftsmen. The dale's wealth made it a prime target for [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]], who seeks both its resources and strategic position. The systematic undead campaign has forced most rural populations to abandon their valuable properties and flee to the heavily fortified city of Tegal's Mark.

## Current State

**Rural Areas:** Systematic evacuation ongoing as undead forces expand their territory. Wealthy estates and trading posts abandoned, their treasures now funding Vorlag's operations.

**Tegal's Mark:** Overcrowded but well-supplied, the city's wealth helps manage the refugee crisis better than other dales. Strong mercenary presence hired to defend trade interests.

**Trade Routes:** Major disruption to commerce, with heavily guarded convoys the only safe passage.
