# Harrowdale - Coastal Refuge Under Threat

**Population:** 44,000 (coastal, forests and orchards)  
**Status:** Struggling Dale - Coastal settlements swollen with refugees fleeing monster-infested forests  
**Capital:** New Velar (large coastal city, not fortified)

## Regional Description

Harrowdale stretches along the coast with dense forests inland, traditionally known for its orchards and fishing industry. The dale's coastal position provided natural protection from inland threats, but [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]]'s corruption of the Velarswood has forced massive population shifts toward the sea. The temple to Eilistraee in the forest provides some sanctuary, but most of the inland territory has become dangerous wilderness.

## Current State

**Coastal Areas:** Overcrowded with refugee camps and makeshift settlements. Fishing industry strained by increased population demands.

**Velarswood Forest:** Partially corrupted and monster-infested, with pockets of sanctuary around the Eilistraee temple.

**Inland Settlements:** Mostly abandoned, with survivors either fled to coast or gathered around the few remaining protected areas.

## Strategic Importance

Harrowdale's coastal position makes it crucial for maritime trade and potential evacuation routes. Vorlag's corruption of the inland forests serves to drive populations toward the coast, creating overcrowding and resource strain. The Shadowmere Pool provides a strategic Shadowfell connection, while the surviving temple to Eilistraee represents a significant obstacle to complete territorial control.

## Government Challenges

The [[Dalelands#Political Landscape|Harrowdale Government]] faces unique challenges managing a massive refugee crisis while maintaining coastal defenses. The transformation from an agricultural economy to a primarily fishing-based one strains traditional governance structures. Maritime trade provides some economic stability, but the government struggles to defend both coastline and remaining inland territories simultaneously.
