# The Stillwater Vale

## Geographic Overview

The Stillwater Vale is a verdant river valley right in the middle of the ancient forest Semberholme, positioned strategically between the [[Dalelands#Geographic Overview|Dalelands]] settlements of [[Mistledale#Regional Description|Mistledale]] and [[Deepingdale#Regional Description|Deepingdale]]. This pastoral landscape masks darker secrets, with leylines of weakened planar energy running beneath the surface, making it particularly susceptible to necromantic influence as described in [[Vorlag's Influence#Overview|Vorlag's Influence]].

## Regional Settlements & Travel

### Connections to the [[Dalelands#Geographic Overview|Dalelands]]

The Stillwater Vale sits between [[Mistledale#Regional Description|Mistledale]] and [[Deepingdale#Regional Description|Deepingdale]], providing strategic access to both major Dale settlements while remaining isolated from the main conflicts affecting the [[Dalelands#Geographic Overview|Dalelands]] region.

**[[Mistledale#Notable Locations|Ashabenford]] ([[Mistledale#Regional Description|Mistledale]]):**

### Regional Settlements

**Scattered Homesteads & Hamlets:**
Most settlements between the Vale and the main Dale cities are:
- Small farming communities (1-2 days apart)
- Isolated homesteads along river tributaries  
- Abandoned settlements reclaimed by wilderness
- Trading posts at trail junctions

**Travel Considerations:**
- Standard travel: 24 miles/day maximum on good roads
- Forest/wilderness travel: 12-18 miles/day depending on conditions
- Cursed characters may face additional delays from undead encounters
- Weather and seasonal conditions significantly affect travel times

### Scattered Settlements
The Vale beyond major settlements is sparsely populated:
- Isolated farmsteads along river tributaries
- Small hamlets in forest clearings
- Abandoned settlements reclaimed by wilderness
- Hermit dwellings and hidden refuges

## Supernatural Elements

### Planar Convergence
The Stillwater Vale sits on a confluence of weakened planar energiesâ€”a "thin spot" to the Shadowfell. This makes the area particularly susceptible to:
- Necromantic magic and undead influences
- Supernatural creatures crossing between planes
- Lingering spirits and ghostly manifestations
- Areas where the boundary between life and death grows thin

### Leyline Network
Ancient magical energies flow beneath the landscape:
- Concentrated around [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]]
- Affected by celestial events (new moons strengthen the connection)
- Can be tapped by those with knowledge of the old ways
- Currently being exploited by [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]] for her dark purposes

## Climate and Seasons

The Vale experiences a temperate climate with distinct seasons that affect both natural and supernatural elements:

**Spring:** Rivers run high, forest awakens, but also when restless spirits are most active
**Summer:** Peaceful and prosperous, supernatural activity at its lowest
**Autumn:** Harvest time, but also when the veil between worlds grows thin
**Winter:** Harsh and isolating, when dark magic is strongest and travel becomes dangerous

## Current Threats

Since [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]'s arrival, the Vale is starting to face unprecedented dangers:
- Undead emerging from corrupted burial sites
- Increased aggressive wildlife driven from deeper forest
- Supernatural cold and blight affecting crops and livestock
- Strange lights and sounds in the night
- Disappearances of travelers and isolated settlers

## Campaign Integration

The Stillwater Vale serves as the primary region for the early stages of "The Unblinking Eye" campaign. Each location provides:

- **Multiple approach options** (combat, negotiation, stealth)
- **Detailed encounter mechanics** with specific CR ratings
- **Interconnected storylines** linking locations together
- **Resource management** through loot and supply locations
- **Information gathering** opportunities about [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Goals|Vorlag's plans]]
