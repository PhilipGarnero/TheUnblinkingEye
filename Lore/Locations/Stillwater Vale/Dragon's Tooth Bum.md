# Dragon's Tooth Bum

## Overview
A shadowy cavern mouth yawns open in the dragon's tooth mountains, where jagged peaks pierce the sky like ancient fangs. The air carries the acrid scent of sulfur and old smoke, while distant howls of goblins and gnolls echo through the rocky crags. Locals whisper that those who venture too deep into the "bum" never return. Strange draconic symbols carved into weathered stone near the entrance hint at older, more dangerous inhabitants.

## Letters and Documents

### Letter 1: Supply Coordination
*Found in Main Chamber treasure chest, written on parchment with dragon-scale watermark*

"Keth,

The [[Shadowdale#Notable Locations|Scale Warehouse]] shipment arrives on the 15th. [[Thorin Brasscale]] sends his regards and three cases of the requested potions. The healing draughts are for your people - the poison is for opportunities.

The [[Shadowdale#Notable Locations|Starfall Mill]] network reports increased activity near [[Harrowdale]] borders. [[Gareth Darkwater]] suggests we may need to accelerate our timeline.

Burn this after reading.

- S"

### Letter 2: Goblin Recruitment Update
*Found in Storage Area, hastily scrawled on rough paper*

"Shadow,

The goblin tribes grow restless. Chief Snagtooth's band shows interest in our proposals, especially after seeing what happened to the Rotclaw tribe. Vorlag's lieutenants turned them into shambling corpses - exactly the demonstration we needed.

The goblins prefer gold and protection over undeath. We can offer both. Moving to secure their allegiance before the pale witch claims more tribes.

Three clans remain neutral. Time is short.

- K"

### Letter 3: Artifact Intelligence
*Found in Ritual Chamber, written in coded script (DC 15 Investigation to decode)*

"To the Tooth Outpost,

Priority targets confirmed:
- **[[The Phalanx of Whispers]]**: Vorlag's forces claimed it from [[The Ancestor Mounds]]. Too well-guarded now.
- **Crown of the Dusk Lord**: Located in [[Sessrendale ruins]] cathedral crypts. This is likely a base of operations for Vorlag forces but she's focused on the east right now. Window of opportunity.
- **Bone Grimoire of Zylkresk**: Near [[Harrowdale]] border ruins. Both parties seeking. Race conditions apply.

Recommend focusing on the Crown. Vorlag's attention is elsewhere for now.

The dragons' ascension awaits no one.

- [[The Scaled Shadow]]"

### Letter 4: Sealed Orders
*Found on [[Keth Darkclaw]]'s person, sealed with black wax dragon seal*

"Keth Darkclaw,

The situation at [[Shadowdale#Notable Locations|The Echoing Ruins]] requires careful monitoring. Vorlag's corruption attempt failed, but she will try again. We cannot allow her to control the leylines - not because she threatens us, but because she threatens the balance.

If her next attempt appears likely to succeed, offer assistance. A corrupted leyline may be useful if we can control a dracolich.

Report any changes immediately through [[Shadowdale#Notable Locations|Starfall Mill]].

Your service to the ascending dragons is noted.

- [[The Scaled Shadow]]

*P.S. - The green dragon in [[Shadowdale#Notable Locations|The Hidden Valley]] has agreed to counsel if needed. Approach with proper respect.*"

### Letter 5: Collaboration Evidence
*Found in Intelligence Documents, partially burned*

"[...] agreed to share information regarding the temple ruins. Vorlag's research into the Sunstone's powers complements our dracolich preparations. Both parties benefit from [...] 

[...] mutual enemies more dangerous than our rivalry. The paladins from [...] pose greater threat than our competition for artifacts. Temporary cooperation advised [...]

[...] when the time comes for true ascension, we shall get rid of [...]."
