# Dragon's Tooth Bum

## Overview
A cavern seemingly going deep inside the dragon's tooth mountains, a chain of hills and small mountains. The tallest one resembles a Dragon's tooth, hence the name. The mountains are inhabited mostly by creatures like goblins and gnolls whom established tribal camps there. No human tried to venture further than a few dozen yards inside the bum by fear of never coming back.
