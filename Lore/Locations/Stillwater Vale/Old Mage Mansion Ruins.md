### Critical Research Discovered

**Shadowfell Anchor Network Map**:
The ancient mage's research reveals a comprehensive network of **15 potential anchor locations** across the Dalelands where planar barriers are naturally thin. These sites are marked with arcane symbols on detailed maps, showing theoretical points where Shadowfell convergence could be established.

**Mapped Anchor Locations**:
- **[[The Ancestor Mounds]]** (Stillwater Vale)
- **[[The Weeping Mounds]]** (Tasseldale)
- **[[Silverleaf Cemetery]]** (Mistledale)
- **[[Saltmere Village]]** (Harrowdale)
- **[[Sessrendale ruins]]** (Ancient ruins)
- **[[Grimwood Hollow]]** (Deepingdale)
- **[[The Circle of Draconic Hymns]]** (Shadowdale)
- **[[Ashgrain Mill]]** (Battledale)
- **[[The Twisted Spire]]** (Deepingdale)
- **[[The Echoing Ruins]]** (Shadowdale)
- **[[The Wailing Mounds]]** (Featherdale)
- **[[Deadwater Marsh]]** (Tasseldale)
- **[[The Sunken Cemetery]]** (Deepingdale)
- **[[Ravenshollow Outpost]]** (Archendale)
- **[[Thornwall Keep]]** (Stillwater Vale)

**Research Notes**: Each location is marked with detailed leyline intersection points, optimal ritual timing, and required corruption methods. The mage's notes indicate that activating all 15 anchors would create a permanent planar convergence, making the entire Dalelands region a Shadowfell reflection. **Current status of each anchor point can only be determined by using the Crystal Focusing Array**.
