# Fenwater Crossing & The Ferryman's Hut

## Overview
The main north-south road in the Vale crosses the River Stillwater at a wide, slow-moving point an hour's ride north of the village. There is no bridge, only a large, sturdy raft-ferry operated by an old, reclusive ferryman named Silas.

## Characteristics
- The ferry is large enough for a horse and cart. Silas poles it across the river using a guide rope.
- Silas's small, moss-covered hut sits on the western bank, marked by a perpetually smoking chimney.
- Silas is tight-lipped but observant. He sees everyone who comes and goes along the road and can be a valuable source of rumors if plied with coin or drink.

## Encounter: Silas the Informant
**Encounter Difficulty**: Social/Information Gathering with Combat Elements
**Location**: Ferry crossing point on River Stillwater
**Primary Objective**: Gain intelligence and establish ongoing protection arrangement

### Silas (NPC Details)
**Description**: Human male, age 65, weathered face with keen observational skills
**Voice**: Sudden/indirect with nasal placement, dry air quality, and quiet volume
**Personality**: Friendly but cautious tone, values practical exchanges over charity
**Stats**: Commoner with +3 to Insight and Perception checks

### Bandit Problem
**The Threat**: 6 **Bandits** (CR 1/8 each) led by **Grix Ironfist** (CR 1/2) extort 10 gp "protection fee" per tenday

**Silas's Information**:
- Bandits camp 2 miles north in abandoned mill ruins
- They return every 3 days (next visit: tomorrow at noon)
- Leader carries a map showing other extortion targets

**Player Options**:
1. **Track to Camp**: Follow them back to mill ruins, fight them there
2. **Ferry Ambush**: Wait at crossing for their return tomorrow, surprise attack
3. **Ignore the issue**: Pay 2 gp per travel instead of 2cp.

**Bandit Loot**:
- **Protection Racket**: 85 gp collected from other victims
- **[[Low level magical items#Flint of the Sure-Strike|Flint of sure strike]]**

### Dragon Cult Intelligence (Revealed After Combat)
**Discovery Method**: Information emerges during interrogation or from defeated bandits

**Grix Ironfist's Confession**:
- These bandits are now refugees
- Their original hideout was in the mountains near [[Dragon's Tooth Bum#Overview|Dragon's Tooth Bum]]
- Were driven out by Dragon Cultists who took over the cavern system
- Fled to the abandoned mill and increased extortion out of desperation for survival

**Witnessed Cult Activities**:
- **War Cry**: Bandits report cultists shouted "For the Sun Dragon!" during their attacks
- **Recruitment**: Cultists were enslaving/recruiting local mountain tribes and bandit groups
- **Preparations**: Heard mentions of preparing for "something big" but fled before learning details
- **Territorial Expansion**: Cult systematically clearing the mountain area of non-aligned groups

**Witte Sisse Connection**:
- The "For the Sun Dragon!" war cry immediately resonates with his temple background
- Recognizes this as a corrupted perversion of Lathander sun worship
- His divine knowledge identifies this as dangerous corruption of solar divine magic
- **Personal Motivation**: Religious duty to investigate and stop this corruption of his faith

**Quest Hook**: This intelligence transforms a simple bandit problem into discovery of a significant cult threat, providing natural progression to investigate [[Dragon's Tooth Bum#Overview|Dragon's Tooth Bum]].
