# Fenwater Crossing & The Ferryman's Hut

## Overview
The main north-south road in the Vale crosses the River Stillwater at a wide, slow-moving point a half-day's ride south of the village. There is no bridge, only a large, sturdy raft-ferry operated by an old, reclusive ferryman named Silas.

## Characteristics
- The ferry is large enough for a horse and cart. Silas poles it across the river using a guide rope.
- Silas's small, moss-covered hut sits on the western bank, marked by a perpetually smoking chimney.
- Silas is tight-lipped but observant. He sees everyone who comes and goes along the road and can be a valuable source of rumors if plied with coin or drink.
