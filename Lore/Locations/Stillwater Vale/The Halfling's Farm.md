# The Halfling's Farm

## Overview
Owned by Finzin Arnberry, living alone in the western hills across the river. Finzin could probably have some information about other halfling communities which could interest Yuyu. The farm serves as both a potential safe haven and information hub for the halfling network throughout the region.

## Encounter: Farm Under Siege & Safe Haven
**Encounter Difficulty**: Medium (CR 4-5 total)
**Situation**: Corrupted creatures attacking farm when party arrives

### Farm Under Attack
**Undead Livestock** (triggered by [[The Death's Eye]] curse):
