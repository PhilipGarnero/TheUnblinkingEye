# The Ancestor Mounds

## Overview
Two very large stone mounds that served as a burial place for ancestors of the Vale. The legend says Erlan the Unbent, an Old Folk hero, sacrificed himself in a battle against the Myrkul envoy Zylkresk Mindeater in order to save the region. These sacred sites are parts of the plan of Vorlag's and she will desecrate and steal relics from them, corrupting their ancient purpose.

## Layout
- The mounds are a mile from the village edge
- Ancient burial sites of the "Old Folk" and tribal chieftains
- Considered sacred ground that people should leave alone especially after dark
- Rich with old magic and ancestral spirits (now corrupted)

## Current State
- Disturbed earth from necromantic activities
- Unnatural cold spots that linger
- Areas where undead have emerged from the ground
- Crude necromantic symbols scrawled on ancient stones
- One remaining relic hidden within: **[[Magical Items#Erlan's Unbendable Resolve|Erlan's Unbendable Resolve]]** (Vorlag has already stolen **[[Cursed Artifacts#The Phalanx of Whispers (Stolen by Vorlag)|The Phalanx of Whispers]]**)
- **Main Mound**: Contains Fred's ritual corpse and active planar weakening ritual. The ritual corpse is bound to protective ward stones that have been corrupted into Shadowfell anchors.
- **Second Mound**: Jamy imprisoned, Dusk Priest preparing second ritual to create another corpse bound to ward stones

## Encounter: Lyanna Swiftarrow - Wounded Scout
**Location**: Hidden near the Main Mound entrance
**Condition**: Injured from Bone Hound attack (reduced to 8 HP, bleeding)
**Personality**: Determined but in pain, grateful for healing

**Information Lyanna Provides**:
- Attempted to scout the mounds but was ambushed by "bones flying like bullets"
- Confirms both mounds are active with ritual activity
- Warns of traps and organized defenses
- "I destroyed a strong skeleton in the main mound, but something felt wrong about it"
- Will join party if healed


## Main Mound - The Completed Ritual
**Encounter Difficulty**: Hard (CR 5-6 total)
**Primary Threat**: Fred has been transformed into a Ritual Corpse, ritual cannot be stopped

### Layout
- **Entrance**: Stone steps descending 20 feet underground
- **Antechamber**: 20x20 ft room with bone sculptures and scattered bones
- **Main Chamber**: 30x40 ft ritual chamber with raised dais where Fred stands
- **East Alcove**: Storage for ritual components
- **West Alcove**: Erlan's opened tomb with mummy wrappings and hidden charm

### Traps
1. **Reassembling Skeleton** (Antechamber): Bones scattered on floor from Lyanna's battle. When cursed PCs enter, skeleton reassembles automatically. See [[Reassembling Skeleton]] for stats.
2. **Bone Caltrops** (Main Chamber): DC 12 Perception to spot, difficult terrain, 1d4 piercing damage per 5 feet moved
3. **Collapsing Ceiling** (Triggered by loud noises): DC 15 Dexterity save, 2d6 bludgeoning damage, prone

### Enemies
- **1 Bone Ritualist** (CR 1/2) - Guarding the completed ritual
- **1 Ritual Corpse (Fred)** (CR 2) - Village blacksmith, bound to the dais, ritual complete
- **1 Bone Hound** (CR 1) - Patrolling the main chamber
- **2 Lesser Skeletons** (CR 1/8 each) - Guarding alcoves

### Special Locations
**Erlan's Tomb (West Alcove)**: 
- Stone sarcophagus has been pried open
- Mummy wrappings scattered around (ancient preservation)
- **Hidden**: Erlan's Unbendable Resolve tucked in the wrappings (DC 13 Investigation)

### Main Mound Loot
- **Bone Ritualist**: dagger, ritual robes, 2d6 gp in bone jewelry
- **Ritual Corpse (Fred)**: Blacksmith's hammer (masterwork, +1 to crafting), 1d8 gp

### Tactical Notes
- Fred's transformation is permanent - he cannot be saved or redeemed
- Ritual Corpse (Fred) cannot leave the main chamber due to binding to the corrupted ward stones
- Bone Hound uses spike volleys
- Destroying Fred allows the spirits to appear but also triggers his Death Bomb ability
- Reassembling Skeleton requires specific tactics to permanently destroy

## Second Mound - The Preparation
**Encounter Difficulty**: Medium (CR 3-4 total)
**Primary Objective**: Rescue Jamy before ritual completion

### Layout
- **Entrance**: Hidden door (DC 13 Investigation) behind fallen stones
- **Tunnel**: 40-foot sloping passage leading to the ritual chamber
- **Prison Chamber**: 15x15 ft room where Jamy is held, adjacent to ritual chamber
- **Ritual Chamber**: 25x30 ft room with incomplete ritual circle

### Traps
1. **Alarm Rune** (Tunnel midpoint): DC 13 Arcana to identify, DC 15 to dispel. If triggered, alerts all enemies and starts **5-turn countdown** - Dusk Priest will sacrifice Jamy on turn 5 if not stopped.

### Enemies
- **1 Dusk Priest** (CR 2) - Leading the ritual preparation
- **2 Dusk Acolytes** (CR 1/4 each) - Assisting with ritual components

- Shackles and rope (can be repurposed)

**Ritual Chamber**:

- Obsidian ritual knife (25 gp, can be used as dagger)
- Scroll case with necromantic notes (worth 20 gp to scholars)

### Vorlag's Message to the Dusk Priest
*Found on the Dusk Priest's body, written on parchment with a wax seal bearing a skull and eye symbol*

**Brother Kaelen,**

The second phase begins at the mounds. Transform the surviving villager as we did the first - their life force will anchor the planar tears we require. The ritual circle I have provided must be completed exactly as instructed.

Once both anchors are established, abandon this site. The corruption here will continue to spread without our presence. Travel south to **Saltmere Village** in [[Harrowdale]]. The coastal hamlet will serve our next phase - the harbor provides access to deeper waters where ancient things stir.

Brother Malachar will meet you at the **Weeping Lighthouse** one month hence, when the autumn moon wanes. Prepare the lighthouse beacon - its light will guide more than ships to shore.

Remember - the locals must witness enough to spread fear, but not so much as to bring organized resistance before our work is complete. Let a few escape to tell their tales.

Our lord is growing more content with each soul we claim. Soon, the barriers between the planes will be as gossamer, and the dead shall reclaim dominion over the living.

**To the everlasting Dusk,**  
**Vorlag the Pale**

*P.S. - Preserve any ritual components from the tomb. The Old Magic still serves our greater working.*

### Tactical Notes
- **Countdown Mechanic**: If alarm triggers, Dusk Priest begins emergency ritual:
  - Turn 1-2: Moves to ritual chamber, begins chanting
  - Turn 3-4: Drags Jamy to ritual circle, raises dagger
  - Turn 5: Sacrifices Jamy unless stopped
- Dusk Priest prioritizes completing ritual over combat
- Lyanna (if found and healed) knows secret entrance that bypasses tunnel trap entirely
- Acolytes will try to delay intruders if countdown starts
- Jamy can be rescued unconscious if reduced to 0 HP before sacrifice

## Encounter: Ancestral Spirits' Guidance
**Trigger**: After main mound is cleared

The spirits of the Old Folk ancestors manifest to those who approach with respect and pure intentions. These translucent figures provide warnings about Vorlag's plans and offer blessings to cleanse their desecrated resting place. The spirits can:
- Grant temporary protection against undead (advantage on saves vs. undead for 24 hours)
- Reveal the password for the [[Thornwall Keep]]
- Teach the ancient words needed to activate [[The Whispering Grove]] cleansing rituals
- Show visions of Vorlag's advances in other regions
- Provide the true history of Erlan the Unbent's sacrifice and Zylkresk Mindeater's defeat and tell about the charm's power and the cursed phalanx.
- **Special**: If Jamy is saved, grant inspiration to all party members
