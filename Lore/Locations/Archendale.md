# Archendale - The Fortress Dale

**Population:** 60,000 (wealthy fortified trading dale)  
**Status:** Functioning Dale - Most fortified dale due to isolation, Archenbridge is a fortress  
**Capital:** Archenbridge (heavily fortified fortress city)

## Regional Description

Archendale is the most isolated and heavily fortified of the dales, positioned at the region's eastern edge. Known for its wealth from trade and its impregnable fortress city of Archenbridge, the dale has successfully maintained independence through superior defenses and strategic isolation. [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s forces have made limited progress here due to the dale's military strength and geographic advantages.

## Current State

**Archenbridge:** Fortress city capable of withstanding extended siege, serving as the last bastion of dale independence.

**Border Territories:** Heavily patrolled and fortified, creating effective barriers against invasion.

**Trade Routes:** Well-defended caravan routes maintained through military escort and fortified waypoints.

**Interior:** Secure agricultural and mining areas protected by overlapping defensive networks.
