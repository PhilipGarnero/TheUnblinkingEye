# Stillwater Creek: Story Lines

## Aftermath of the Moonlit Raid ([[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]])

The immediate aftermath is a scene of chaos, fear, and dawning horror. The night air is thick with the smell of smoke, blood, and an unnatural, grave-like chill. The village size is assumed to be reduced (approx. 20-25 homes, pop. 100-125).

### 1. Physical State of the Village

* **Damaged Homes:** With the smaller village, the impact is more visible. At least 3-4 cottages near [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]]/[[Direwood Forest#Overview|Direwood]] fringe are heavily damaged – doors smashed in, windows shattered, sections of their thatched roofs perhaps catching fire from overturned lanterns or spells during the fight.
* **The Shrine of Ancestors/River Spirit:** If [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]] had a specific interest in it, it bears signs of her attention. Sacred stones might be overturned, crude necromantic symbols hastily scrawled in ash or blood on the altar, or small animal offerings made by villagers now lie desiccated and twisted.
* **Casualties – A Heavy Toll:**
    * **Dead:** In a village this size, even a few deaths are a tragedy that touches everyone. Perhaps 2-3 villagers are slain directly (e.g., an elderly couple who couldn't flee their home, a young fisher who tried to fight with a club). Another 1-2 might die from their wounds shortly after if not tended to quickly. [[Brother Marcus Dawnward#Basic Information|Brother Marcus Dawnward]] of the Order of the Gauntlet was assassinated by [[Malachar Shadowbane#Basic Information|Malachar Shadowbane]], who struck from shadow while the cleric was channeling divine energy to turn a mass of skeletons threatening the village children.
        * *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2014), p. 246, "Social Interaction" notes on community impact.*
    * **Wounded:** Another 6-8 villagers are injured – cuts, broken bones, some with the terrifying chill of a skeleton's touch lingering. [[Village NPCs#Goody Hepzibah Pinesong|Goody Pinesong]] will be overwhelmed.
* **Lingering Traces:** The ground near where Skeletons emerged from [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]] is disturbed, with fresh earth overturned. An unnatural coldness clings to these areas and to the places where undead were destroyed. Any remaining skeletal parts will be a grim reminder.

### 2. Emotional State of the Villagers

* **Terror and Shock:** This is the overriding emotion. The dead walked and attacked them. Their peaceful, predictable lives have been violated by an unimaginable horror. They are jumpy, reacting to every shadow and sound.
* **Grief and Loss:** Tears flow freely for the dead and wounded. In a community where everyone knows each other, each loss is personal and deeply felt. They will huddle together, seeking comfort.
* **Gratitude Tinged with Fear (Towards PCs):**
    * Initially, there's immense gratitude for the PCs who stood against the tide of undead. They saved lives, and many will acknowledge this.
    * However, once **The Death Eye** marks on the PCs become visible (perhaps as they help the wounded or when the adrenaline fades), a new kind of fear creeps in. The villagers will see them as heroes tainted by the same evil that attacked them. Whispers will start: "They fought bravely, but look at them now... bearing the necromancer's **Death Eye**!" "Are they safe to be around?" "Will they draw more of *them* here?"
* **Despair and Vulnerability:** Their sense of security is shattered. Stillwater Creek felt safe and isolated; now it feels exposed and terribly vulnerable.
* **Anger:** Some villagers, like [[Village NPCs#Finn Tarvinson and his Cronies (Brynn & Tad)|Finn Tarvinson]] and his cronies, might try to mask their fear with anger, looking for someone to blame. While [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]] is the obvious target, their fear might cause them to lash out at the PCs for being "different" or "marked."

### 3. The PCs' Situation

* **[[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]] Curse:** The curse is palpable – a cold gut twisting sensation. The mark itself is visible, a greenish, vein-like pattern that subtly resembles a staring eye.
    * *DM Note:* Describe how it feels to *them*. When they try to rest, the first nightmares hit.
* **Heroes Under a Cloud:** They are recognized for their bravery, but their new marks set them apart. They'll notice villagers staring, pulling children away, or making warding signs.
* **Immediate Needs:** Rest (though it will be fitful), healing for any injuries sustained, and answers about what has happened to them.

### 4. Immediate Problems & Tasks in the Village

* **Tending to the Wounded:** This is the first priority. [[Village NPCs#Goody Hepzibah Pinesong|Goody Hepzibah Pinesong]] will be rushing between the injured, her supplies of herbs and bandages quickly dwindling. PCs with healing skills (Healer's Kit proficiency, Lay on Hands, spells like *Cure Wounds* or *Healing Word*) will be critical.
* **Dealing with the Dead (Villagers and Undead):**
    * A grim debate will ensue: What to do with the villagers who died? Burial in [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]] is now unthinkable. Burning the bodies might be suggested out of fear they too could rise. This is a deeply upsetting prospect for the grieving.
    * What about the remains of the Skeletons? Burning them seems safest.
    * As they are dealing with the bodies, a slain villager heavily suffused with [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]]'s energy, near a PC bearing **[[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]]** groans and begins to stir, forcing a horrified reaction and a swift, grim re-killing. This would cement the fear of **[[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]]** and its connection to undeath.
* **Securing the Village:** Fear of another attack will be high. Remaining able-bodied villagers, led by people like [[Village NPCs#Torvin Graypelt|Torvin Graypelt]] or even a more assertive [[Village NPCs#Jebediah "Jeb" Stone|Jebediah "Jeb" Stone]], will try to organize a watch. They might try to barricade damaged homes or the main paths into the village. They will be poorly equipped and terrified. Fortunately, the **Order of the Gauntlet investigators** have taken charge of organizing proper defenses, with [[Ser Gareth Brightshield#Basic Information|Ser Gareth Brightshield]] establishing patrol routes and [[Thorgrim Ironwill#Basic Information|Thorgrim Ironwill]] reinforcing key defensive positions.
* **Seeking Answers:** [[Elder Rowan Meadowlight#Basic Information|Elder Rowan Meadowlight]] will be the focus of many questions. He will examine the PCs' marks, consult any old texts he has (likely finding nothing), and confirm that he won't be useful at all. He will strongly advise them to seek help beyond Stillwater Creek. [[Lyanna Swiftarrow#Basic Information|Lyanna Swiftarrow]] will be particularly interested in tracking the source of the undead attack, offering to share her findings with the PCs. The surviving Order members mourn their fallen cleric, and [[Ser Gareth Brightshield#Basic Information|Ser Gareth Brightshield]] may ask the PCs to help recover [[Brother Marcus Dawnward#Items|Brother Marcus's blessed items]] from his body.
* **The Inevitable Departure:** While some villagers will remain grateful, the underlying fear of the PCs' curse will grow. [[Elder Rowan Meadowlight#Basic Information|Elder Rowan Meadowlight]] might gently tell them, "For your own sakes, and for the peace of this village, you must seek a cure elsewhere. Your presence now, marked by **[[The Death's Eye#Visual Sign|The Death's Eye]]**, will only bring more fear... and perhaps more of [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]]'s attention." Others, like [[Village NPCs#Finn Tarvinson and his Cronies (Brynn & Tad)|Finn Tarvinson]], might be more blunt: "You're cursed! Get out before you bring that thing back down on us!"

## Clues and Leads

Amidst the chaos, some clues might emerge, pointing towards future paths:

* **Vorlag's Origin Point:** It will be clear the attack was staged from [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]]. Tracks, disturbed earth, or a lingering cold spot could be investigated (leads to [[Path 1 - The Hunted's Hunt (Direct Confrontation)]]).
* **Words of the Necromancer:** His parting taunts about **[[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]]** are the most direct clue. [[Elder Rowan Meadowlight#Basic Information|Elder Rowan Meadowlight]] will emphasize the need to find someone who understands such "marks."
* **Unusual Item (Hooks for Path 1):** If one of the PCs speak with [[Village NPCs#Young Lissie Fallowfield|Young Lissie Fallowfield]] they might get directed to [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|the Ancestor's mound]]. If they go there with [[Elder Rowan Meadowlight#Basic Information|Elder Rowan Meadowlight]], he will say that a peculiar item amidst the bones of a defeated Skeleton (perhaps one that seemed to direct others, or one near [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]]), or at a spot where [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag]] stood:
    * A small, oddly carved bone that feels colder than the others and perhaps has a faint, eye-like carving.
    * A tattered shred of parchment with a single, unknown rune or a fragment of a map.
    * A pinch of unusual dust (e.g., powdered obsidian or bone meal mixed with something else) that seems to react faintly to their curse.
* **[[Elder Rowan Meadowlight#Quests|Elder Rowan Meadowlight]]'s Suggestions (Hooks for [[Path 2 - Seeking wisdom (Lift curse through help)]] & [[Path 3 - The Prey's Struggle to Safety (Fleeing Vorlag's Influence)]]):** He will explicitly mention potential sources of aid: the sage **Hemlock Grimsby in Oakhaven**, the **Temple of the Sun God in Veridia**, or the distant hope of **lands free from necromantic taint**.
* **Order of the Gauntlet Intelligence:** The investigators have been tracking undead activity across the region and can provide valuable information:
    * [[Ser Gareth Brightshield#Basic Information|Ser Gareth Brightshield]] knows of similar attacks in other isolated settlements, suggesting a coordinated campaign. He is particularly disturbed by reports of a "dark elf assassin" seen at multiple attack sites.
    * [[Lyanna Swiftarrow#Basic Information|Lyanna Swiftarrow]] has tracked undead movements and identified [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|the Ancestor Mounds]] and [[Direwood Forest#Overview|Direwood]] as spots of necromantic energy. She found strange drow tracks leading away from [[Brother Marcus Dawnward#Basic Information|Brother Marcus]]'s body, suggesting his killer escaped toward the mounds.
    * [[Brother Marcus Dawnward#Basic Information|Brother Marcus]]'s body shows evidence of a precise magical attack—likely *Inflict Wounds*—and bears wounds consistent with enchanted weapons.
    * [[Thorgrim Ironwill#Basic Information|Thorgrim Ironwill]] offers practical supplies and warns of increased undead activity along major roads leading out of the valley. He noticed a figure in dark robes directing the skeleton assault but lost sight of them in the chaos.
    * The Order had planned to cleanse [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|the Ancestor Mounds]], but with [[Brother Marcus Dawnward#Basic Information|Brother Marcus]]'s assassination, they lack the divine power necessary for proper consecration. [[Ser Gareth Brightshield#Basic Information|Ser Gareth Brightshield]] admits they are now limited to defensive actions and cannot tackle the source of the corruption without a cleric. They desperately need the PCs' help or must wait for reinforcements from their order.
