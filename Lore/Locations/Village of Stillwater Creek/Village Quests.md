	# Stillwater Creek: Village Quests

## Pre-Attack Quests (2 Options)

### Quest 1: The Missing Sheep
**Giver:** [[Village NPCs#Torvin Graypelt|Torvin Graypelt]] (Hunter)  
**Hook:** Several sheep have gone missing from the village flocks over the past few days. Torvin suspects wolves from the Direwood, but the tracks are strange - they seem to lead toward [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]] instead of deeper into the forest.  
**Objective:** Investigate the missing sheep and discover what's taking them.  
**Rewards:** 25 gp, Torvin's respect and future guidance services at half price  
**Truth:** The sheep were taken by skeletons under [[Vorlag's Forces#Organization Structure|Vorlag's command]] for ritual sacrifice at [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]]. PCs will find skeletal remains, blood stains, and ritual circles around the mounds. This provides early warning of necromantic activity and reveals the mounds have been desecrated. Careful investigation (DC 15) reveals that ritual preparations are ongoing - fresh digging and necromantic symbols suggest recent activity.

### Quest 2: Strange Deliveries
**Giver:** [[Village NPCs#Jebediah "Jeb" Stone|Jebediah "Jeb" Stone]]  
**Hook:** A hooded stranger has been making unusual purchases over the past week - large quantities of salt, iron nails, and lamp oil. They paid well but seemed nervous and left quickly each time. Jeb is curious about what someone needs so many "warding supplies" for.  
**Objective:** Investigate who the mysterious buyer is and what they're preparing for.  
**Rewards:** 30 gp, 20% discount at Jeb's store, information about defensive preparations  
**Truth:** The buyer is a hermit namd Gildas Twoorb living on the village outskirts who sensed growing necromantic energy and is desperately trying to ward their home. They can provide warnings about "dark stirrings" and basic knowledge about undead weaknesses.

## Post-Attack Quests (Multiple Options)

### Quest 3: Recovery and Rescue
**Giver:** [[Village NPCs#Goody Hepzibah Pinesong|Goody Hepzibah Pinesong]]  
**Hook:** 2 villagers (Fred & Jamy Sorcier) are still missing and presumed taken during the attack. Goody Pinesong fears they're being held for dark purposes.  
**Objective:** Search the Direwood and surrounding areas for missing villagers.  
**Rewards:** 50 gp, healing poultices (3 uses, restore 1d4+1 HP each). Additional 50 gp if Jamy is rescued alive.  
**Truth:** Fred has been transformed into a Ritual Corpse in [[The Ancestor Mounds#Main Mound - The Completed Ritual|the Main Mound]] and cannot be saved. Jamy is imprisoned in [[The Ancestor Mounds#Second Mound - The Preparation|the Second Mound]] and can be rescued if the party acts quickly before the Dusk Priest completes the ritual. Both are located at [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]].

### Quest 4: The Lost Holy Symbol
**Giver:** [[Ser Gareth Brightshield#Basic Information|Ser Gareth Brightshield]]  
**Hook:** When [[Malachar Shadowbane#Basic Information|Malachar]] struck down [[Brother Marcus Dawnward#Basic Information|Brother Marcus]], the drow assassin ripped the cleric's blessed holy symbol from his neck and hurled it deep into [[Direwood Forest#Overview|the Direwood]] out of spite. The symbol of Torm is essential for the Order's mission against undead.  
**Objective:** Search the forest edge where witnesses saw the necklace thrown to recover the blessed holy symbol.  
**Rewards:** Keep the holy symbol (grants advantage on saves vs. undead), 100 gp, Ser Gareth's gratitude  
**Truth:** The symbol landed deep in the forest undergrowth. PCs face natural hazards, maybe wolves or a few scattered undead drawn to its holy power, but no direct confrontation with Malachar.

### Quest 5: Fortifying the Village
**Giver:** [[Thorgrim Ironwill#Basic Information|Thorgrim Ironwill]]  
**Hook:** The village needs proper defenses against future undead attacks. Thorgrim needs help gathering materials and setting up defensive positions.  
**Objective:** Help construct barricades, set up alarm systems, and train villagers in basic combat.  
**Rewards:** 75 gp, improved village defenses (future attacks are less likely to succeed), villager gratitude  
**Mechanics:** Requires 3 days of work, Survival/Investigation checks to find materials, Athletics/Sleight of Hand for construction.

### Quest 6: Tracking the Source
**Giver:** [[Lyanna Swiftarrow#Basic Information|Lyanna Swiftarrow]]  
**Hook:** The ranger has identified tracks leading from the attack site toward an unknown location deeper in [[Vorlag's Influence#Overview|Vorlag's territory]]. She needs capable allies to follow the trail.  
**Objective:** Track the undead forces back to their staging area and gather intelligence on [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#DM Notes & Key Info|Vorlag's operations]].  
**Rewards:** Lyanna as an ally for future missions  
**Truth:** Trail leads to [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]] where Lyanna discovers the full scope of [[Vorlag's Forces#Organization Structure|Vorlag's desecration]]. She attempts to scout [[The Ancestor Mounds#Main Mound - The Completed Ritual|the main mound]] but is wounded by a Bone Hound and forced to retreat. This quest connects directly to the mound encounters - Lyanna provides crucial intelligence about enemy positions, trap locations, and the urgent need to rescue the missing villagers before it's too late.

### Quest 7: Consecrating the Fallen
**Giver:** [[Elder Rowan Meadowlight#Basic Information|Elder Rowan Meadowlight]]  
**Hook:** The village dead cannot be properly buried in the corrupted [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]]. A new consecrated burial ground must be established, but the ritual requires protection from undead interference.  
**Objective:** Guard Elder Rowan during a day-long consecration ritual to establish a new sacred burial site.  
**Rewards:** 100 gp, permanent sanctuary location (undead cannot approach within 30 feet), Elder Rowan's blessing  
**Prerequisites:** This quest cannot be completed until the corruption at [[The Ancestor Mounds#Overview|The Ancestor Mounds]] is cleansed. Elder Rowan explains that the ancestral spirits are too tormented to allow new consecration while their resting place remains defiled.  
**Mechanics:** PCs face waves of undead trying to disrupt the ritual over 30 minutes. Undead emerge from the direction of the corrupted mounds, drawn by the positive energy. Success creates a safe haven for future use.

### Quest 8: Checking on Finzin
**Giver:** [[Village NPCs#Martha "Ma" Greenthistle & Pipkin "Pip" Solloway|Martha "Ma" Greenthistle]]  
**Hook:** With all the chaos from the attack, no one has heard from [[Finzin Arnberry#Basic Information|Finzin Arnberry]] at his farm across the river. Ma is worried something might have happened to the old farmer and wants someone to check on him.  
**Objective:** Cross the river to [[The Halfling's Farm#Overview|Finzin's farm]] and check on his wellbeing.  
**Rewards:** Free night's stay at The Slow River Inn for the party  
**Truth:** Finzin was fine until the cursed PCs arrived - their presence through [[The Death's Eye#Nature of the Curse|The Death's Eye]] curse caused nearby dead animals and buried livestock to rise as undead. The PCs must fight these newly risen creatures while protecting Finzin.
