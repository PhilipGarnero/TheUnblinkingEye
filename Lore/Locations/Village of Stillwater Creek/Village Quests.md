# Stillwater Creek: Village Quests

## Pre-Attack Quests (2 Options)

### Quest 1: The Missing Sheep
**Giver:** [[Torvin Graypelt]] (Hunter)  
**Hook:** Several sheep have gone missing from the village flocks over the past few days. Torvin suspects wolves from the Direwood, but the tracks are strange - they seem to lead toward the Ancestor Mounds instead of deeper into the forest.  
**Objective:** Investigate the missing sheep and discover what's taking them.  
**Rewards:** 25 gp, Torvin's respect and future guidance services at half price  
**Truth:** The sheep were taken by skeletons under Vorlag's command for ritual sacrifice. PCs will find skeletal remains and blood stains near the mounds, providing early warning of necromantic activity.

### Quest 2: Strange Deliveries
**Giver:** [[Jebediah "Jeb" Stone]]  
**Hook:** A hooded stranger has been making unusual purchases over the past week - large quantities of salt, iron nails, and lamp oil. They paid well but seemed nervous and left quickly each time. Jeb is curious about what someone needs so many "warding supplies" for.  
**Objective:** Investigate who the mysterious buyer is and what they're preparing for.  
**Rewards:** 30 gp, 20% discount at Jeb's store, information about defensive preparations  
**Truth:** The buyer is a hermit namd Gildas Twoorb living on the village outskirts who sensed growing necromantic energy and is desperately trying to ward their home. They can provide warnings about "dark stirrings" and basic knowledge about undead weaknesses.

## Post-Attack Quests (Multiple Options)

### Quest 3: Recovery and Rescue
**Giver:** [[Goody Hepzibah Pinesong]]  
**Hook:** Several villagers are still missing and presumed taken during the attack. Goody Pinesong fears they're being held for dark purposes.  
**Objective:** Search the Direwood and surrounding areas for missing villagers.  
**Rewards:** 100 gp, healing poultices (3 uses, restore 1d4+1 HP each)  
**Truth:** 2-3 villagers are imprisoned in a hidden cave near the mounds, intended for future undead conversion. They can be rescued but bear psychological trauma.

### Quest 4: The Lost Holy Symbol
**Giver:** [[Ser Gareth Brightshield]]  
**Hook:** When Malachar struck down Brother Marcus, the drow assassin ripped the cleric's blessed holy symbol from his neck and hurled it deep into the Direwood out of spite. The symbol of Torm is essential for the Order's mission against undead.  
**Objective:** Search the forest edge where witnesses saw the necklace thrown to recover the blessed holy symbol.  
**Rewards:** Keep the holy symbol (grants advantage on saves vs. undead), 100 gp, Ser Gareth's gratitude  
**Truth:** The symbol landed deep in the forest undergrowth. PCs face natural hazards, maybe wolves or a few scattered undead drawn to its holy power, but no direct confrontation with Malachar.

### Quest 5: Fortifying the Village
**Giver:** [[Thorgrim Ironwill]]  
**Hook:** The village needs proper defenses against future undead attacks. Thorgrim needs help gathering materials and setting up defensive positions.  
**Objective:** Help construct barricades, set up alarm systems, and train villagers in basic combat.  
**Rewards:** 75 gp, improved village defenses (future attacks are less likely to succeed), villager gratitude  
**Mechanics:** Requires 3 days of work, Survival/Investigation checks to find materials, Athletics/Sleight of Hand for construction.

### Quest 6: Tracking the Source
**Giver:** [[Lyanna Swiftarrow]]  
**Hook:** The ranger has identified tracks leading from the attack site toward an unknown location deeper in Vorlag's territory. She needs capable allies to follow the trail.  
**Objective:** Track the undead forces back to their staging area and gather intelligence on Vorlag's operations.  
**Rewards:** 200 gp, detailed map of local undead movements, Lyanna as an ally for future missions  
**Truth:** Leads to a minor outpost where PCs can learn about Vorlag's plans and potentially disrupt her operations.

### Quest 7: Consecrating the Fallen
**Giver:** [[Elder Rowan Meadowlight]]  
**Hook:** The village dead cannot be properly buried in the corrupted Ancestor Mounds. A new consecrated burial ground must be established, but the ritual requires protection from undead interference.  
**Objective:** Guard Elder Rowan during a day-long consecration ritual to establish a new sacred burial site.  
**Rewards:** 100 gp, permanent sanctuary location (undead cannot approach within 30 feet), Elder Rowan's blessing  
**Mechanics:** PCs face waves of undead trying to disrupt the ritual over 8 hours. Success creates a safe haven for future use.

### Quest 8: Checking on Finzin
**Giver:** [[Martha "Ma" Greenthistle]]  
**Hook:** With all the chaos from the attack, no one has heard from [[Finzin Arnberry]] at his farm across the river. Ma is worried something might have happened to the old farmer and wants someone to check on him.  
**Objective:** Cross the river to Finzin's farm and check on his wellbeing.  
**Rewards:** Free night's stay at The Slow River Inn for the party  
**Truth:** Finzin was fine until the cursed PCs arrived - their presence through [[The Death's Eye]] curse caused nearby dead animals and buried livestock to rise as undead. The PCs must fight these newly risen creatures while protecting Finzin.
