# Stillwater Creek: Village Description

**Overall Feel:** A moderately sized village, large enough to have a few basic amenities but small enough that everyone knows each other's business. It's primarily self-sufficient in food but relies on occasional traders for anything more exotic. The mood is generally peaceful, if a little isolated, with an undercurrent of superstition regarding the nearby Direwood and Ancestor Mounds.

## Size and Population

* **Dwellings:** Approximately 20 structures, mostly single-story cottages made of timber and daub with thatched roofs. A few might be two-story, particularly the Inn and perhaps Jeb's Sundries.
* **Population:** Around 50 souls. This includes families with children, working adults, and a number of elders.

## Shops, Services, and Key Locations

Stillwater Creek offers basic necessities but no specialized adventuring gear.

### The Slow River Inn
* **Proprietors:** [[Village NPCs#Martha "Ma" Greenthistle & Pipkin "Pip" Solloway|Martha "Ma" Greenthistle]] and [[Village NPCs#Martha "Ma" Greenthistle & Pipkin "Pip" Solloway|Pipkin "Pip" Solloway]]
* **Services:** Serves watery ale, passable wine, and hearty, simple meals (stews, river fish, dark bread). Has 3-4 small, clean rooms to let with straw mattresses. The common room is the village's social hub.

### Jeb's Sundries (General Store)
* **Proprietor:** [[Village NPCs#Jebediah "Jeb" Stone|Jebediah "Jeb" Stone]]
* **Wares:** Basic supplies: sacks of flour, salt, lamp oil, rope (50ft, hempen), torches, candles, simple clothing, fishing hooks and line, flint & steel, maybe a few waterskins, and basic tools like hammers or wood axes. He might have a couple of daggers or a sling under the counter. Doesn't stock adventurer's kits, specific weapons, or armor.

### Borin's Smithy
* **Proprietor:** [[Village NPCs#Borin Ironfoot|Borin Ironfoot]]
* **Services:** Can repair damaged metal items (basic weapons, tools). Might have a few **daggers** or a **sickle** (Player's Handbook (2014), p. 149) for sale. Could reluctantly agree to craft a **shortsword** or spear if given a few days and coin, but it wouldn't be masterwork. Unlikely to have armor beyond perhaps patching up a simple shield.

### Goody Pinesong's Cottage (Herbalist/Midwife)
* **Proprietor:** [[Village NPCs#Goody Hepzibah Pinesong|Goody Hepzibah Pinesong]]
* **Services:** Can provide poultices for minor wounds (perhaps restoring 1-2 HP outside of combat, once per day per character), herbal remedies for coughs or fevers. Might sell a few common herbs. Does not have potions of healing, but might know what ingredients could go into one if found.

### Shrine of the Ancestors/River Spirit
* **Caretaker:** [[Elder Rowan Meadowlight#Basic Information|Elder Rowan Meadowlight]]
* **Description:** A small, open-air shrine with a few weathered stone plinths and a central, moss-covered altar stone. Faded carvings depict scenes of river life or figures of ancient heroes. It's a place for quiet contemplation and small offerings (flowers, a bit of food, a carved token).

### The Village Green/Square
A small, open area near the Inn, perhaps with a well or a large old oak tree. Used for occasional small festivals or gatherings.

### Fishing Docks
A few rickety wooden piers on the River Stillwater where fishing boats (mostly small coracles or rowboats) are moored. Fish-gutting tables and drying racks are common sights.

## Regional Location

Stillwater Creek sits in **[[The Stillwater Vale - Index|The Stillwater Vale]]**, a secluded valley inbetween [[Mistledale#Regional Description|Mistledale]] and [[Deepingdale#Regional Description|Deepingdale]] within the broader [[Dalelands#Geographic Overview|Dalelands]] region. This region was once within the sphere of influence of the legendary [[The Dusk Lord#Basic Information|The Dusk Lord]] before his banishment to the Shadowfell centuries ago. The vale retains traces of ancient necromantic influence, making it an ideal location for [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]] to begin his master's return.

## Why Stillwater Creek is Targeted by Vorlag

The necromancer [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]] attacks Stillwater Creek for strategic reasons in her campaign to restore the Dusk Lord:

* **Historical Significance:** The Dusk Lord's old seat of power was Sessrendale a dozens of miles west. In order to restore him, Vorlag will need to desecrate all the land that did belong to its territory. The village sits on land that was once directly controlled by him before his banishment. Ancient ley lines and necromantic resonances still echo through the area. 
* **Shadowfell Convergence:** Furthermore, the ancestor's mound of the village contained relics she needed for her desecrating rituals—she has already claimed [[Magical Items#The Phalanx of Whispers|The Phalanx of Whispers]] from the burial site. The location is also a good starting point for rituals as it lies on a confluence of weakened planar energies—a remnant "thin spot" to the Shadowfell left from the Dusk Lord's original dominion. Vorlag intends to exploit these kind of spots to create a permanent anchor point for her master's influence.
* **Isolated Position:** Stillwater Creek's isolation also makes it ideal for changing its population into undeads without drawing too much attention and thus without immediate intervention from Dalelands authorities or major temples.
