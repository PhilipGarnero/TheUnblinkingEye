# The Stillwater Vale

## Geographic Overview

The Stillwater Vale is a verdant river valley surrounded by ancient forests, mysterious mounds, and rolling hills. This pastoral landscape masks darker secrets, with leylines of weakened planar energy running beneath the surface, making it particularly susceptible to necromantic influence.

## Primary Features

### River Stillwater
The lifeblood of the Vale, River Stillwater flows from misty, unmapped hills several days' journey to the northeast—likely the foothills of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains. The river meanders generally southwestward for many leagues before joining a larger tributary or flowing into distant marshlands.

**Characteristics:**
- Relatively slow and shallow near the village
- Easily forded in places during dry seasons
- Fed by several smaller creeks and springs
- Rich with fish, supporting local communities
- No bridge at Stillwater Creek village; nearest crossing points are days away

### Direwood Forest
An ancient woodland that looms to the north and west of Stillwater Creek, its dark canopy forming an imposing barrier. The forest has multiple distinct zones of varying danger and mystery.

**The Outer Reaches:**
- Used by villagers for hunting deer, boar, and rabbits
- Selective logging for village construction needs
- Game trails and familiar paths
- Generally safe during daylight hours

**The Deep Woods:**
- Dense, tangled undergrowth that blocks sunlight
- Unnaturally quiet in places, unsettling to travelers
- Home to wolves, giant spiders, and stranger creatures
- Contains overgrown ruins of a long-lost settlement
- Ancient trees that seem to watch intruders
- Some areas show signs of old druidic influence

### The Ancestor Mounds
A series of low, rolling hills and earthen burial mounds stretching east and southeast of Stillwater Creek. These sacred sites have become Vorlag's staging ground, corrupting their ancient purpose.

**Layout:**
- Closest mounds are a few hundred yards from village edge
- Largest mound sits roughly half a mile out
- Ancient burial sites of the "Old Folk" and tribal chieftains
- Considered taboo ground, especially after dark
- Rich with old magic and ancestral spirits (now corrupted)

**Current State:**
- Disturbed earth from necromantic activities
- Unnatural cold spots that linger
- Areas where undead have emerged from the ground
- Crude necromantic symbols scrawled on ancient stones

### Regional Settlements

**Scattered Homesteads & Hamlets:**
Most settlements between the Vale and the main Dale cities are:
- Small farming communities (1-2 days apart)
- Isolated homesteads along river tributaries  
- Abandoned settlements reclaimed by wilderness
- Trading posts at trail junctions

**Travel Considerations:**
- Standard travel: 24 miles/day maximum on good roads
- Forest/wilderness travel: 12-18 miles/day depending on conditions
- Cursed characters may face additional delays from undead encounters
- Weather and seasonal conditions significantly affect travel times

### Scattered Settlements
The Vale beyond major settlements is sparsely populated:
- Isolated farmsteads along river tributaries
- Small hamlets in forest clearings
- Abandoned settlements reclaimed by wilderness
- Hermit dwellings and hidden refuges

## Points of Interest

### The Whispering Grove
A circular clearing deep in Direwood where ancient druids once gathered. The trees here grow in perfect symmetry, and on certain nights, whispers of old rituals can still be heard on the wind.

### Thornwall Keep (Ruins)
The remnants of an old fortification on a hill overlooking the river valley, built to guard against threats from the Direwood. Now mostly collapsed, but its cellars might still hold treasures or dangers.

### The Singing Stones
A collection of standing stones along the river that hum in certain weather conditions. Local folklore claims they were placed by the Old Folk to mark safe crossing points.

### Shadowmere Pool
A deep, dark pool fed by an underground spring, located where the forest meets the mounds. Locals avoid it, claiming it's cursed, but it serves as a natural scrying focus for those with the knowledge to use it.

### The Lost Road
An overgrown path that once connected Stillwater Creek to settlements deeper in the wilderness. Parts are still visible, marked by old stone waymarkers, but few dare to follow it to its end.

## Supernatural Elements

### Planar Convergence
The Stillwater Vale sits on a confluence of weakened planar energies—a "thin spot" to the Shadowfell. This makes the area particularly susceptible to:
- Necromantic magic and undead influences
- Supernatural creatures crossing between planes
- Lingering spirits and ghostly manifestations
- Areas where the boundary between life and death grows thin

### Leyline Network
Ancient magical energies flow beneath the landscape:
- Concentrated around the Ancestor Mounds
- Affected by celestial events (new moons strengthen the connection)
- Can be tapped by those with knowledge of the old ways
- Currently being exploited by Vorlag for her dark purposes

## Climate and Seasons

The Vale experiences a temperate climate with distinct seasons that affect both natural and supernatural elements:

**Spring:** Rivers run high, forest awakens, but also when restless spirits are most active
**Summer:** Peaceful and prosperous, supernatural activity at its lowest
**Autumn:** Harvest time, but also when the veil between worlds grows thin
**Winter:** Harsh and isolating, when dark magic is strongest and travel becomes dangerous

## Current Threats

Since Vorlag's arrival, the Vale faces unprecedented dangers:
- Undead emerging from corrupted burial sites
- Increased aggressive wildlife driven from deeper forest
- Supernatural cold and blight affecting crops and livestock
- Strange lights and sounds in the night
- Disappearances of travelers and isolated settlers
