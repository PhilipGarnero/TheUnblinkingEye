## Geographic Overview

The Stillwater Vale is a verdant river valley right in the middle of the ancient forest Semberholme, positioned strategically between the [[Dalelands]] settlements of [[Mistledale]] and [[Deepingdale]]. This pastoral landscape masks darker secrets, with leylines of weakened planar energy running beneath the surface, making it particularly susceptible to necromantic influence as described in [[Vorlag's Influence]].

## Points of Interest

### River Stillwater
The lifeblood of the Vale, River Stillwater flows north to south from misty, unmapped hills several days' journey to the northeastâ€”likely the foothills of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains. The river meanders generally southwestward for many leagues before joining a larger tributary or flowing into distant marshlands.

**Characteristics:**
- Forms a calm pond near the village
- Easily forded in places during dry seasons
- Fed by several smaller creeks and springs
- Rich with fish, supporting local communities

**Encounter: The Water Elemental's Memory**
Only after successfully interpreting [[The Singing Stones]] messages does the ancient water elemental Ondrea manifest in the river's deeper pools. This benevolent being remembers the Old Folk and offers crucial knowledge:

**Safe Crossing Knowledge:**
- Three shallow ford points marked by the singing stones
- Times when the river's beast are calmer allowing for safe crossing
- Seasonal patterns that affect water depth and current strength

**Historical Knowledge:**
- Location of Erlan the Unbent's secret resting space in the original burial site
- The true name of the Myrkul envoy Zylkresk Mindeater whom Erlan defeated
- Ritual words that can temporarily (while chanted) cleanse corrupted water sources

**Current Threats:**
- Which tributaries have been tainted by necromantic runoff
- Safe camping spots along the riverbank she can keep guard
- Warning signs that indicate Vorlag's agents have passed through an area

### Direwood Forest
An ancient woodland that looms to the north and west of Stillwater Creek, its dark canopy forming an imposing barrier. The forest has multiple distinct zones of varying danger and mystery.

**The Outer Reaches:**
- Used by villagers for hunting deer, boar, and rabbits
- Selective logging for village construction needs
- Game trails and familiar paths
- Generally safe during daylight hours

**Encounter: Corrupted Wolf Pack**
Dire wolves driven mad by necromantic corruption hunt in unnaturally coordinated packs of 6-8. Unlike normal wolves, they show no fear and fight to the death. Their eyes glow with unnatural green light, and their bite carries a minor curse (Constitution save DC 12 or take 1 point of necrotic damage per day until cured). The pack leader wears a crude collar of bone and sinew, suggesting they may be controlled rather than simply corrupted.

**The Deep Woods:**
- Dense, tangled undergrowth that blocks sunlight
- Unnaturally quiet in places, unsettling to travelers
- Home to wolves, giant spiders, and stranger creatures
- Contains overgrown ruins of a long-lost settlement
- Ancient trees that seem to watch intruders
- Some areas show signs of old druidic influence

**Encounter: The Hermit Druid**
Elderoak, an ancient human druid (age 80+), has been studying the corruption from a hidden treehouse sanctuary. His voice is sustained/direct with throaty placement and slow tempo. He offers crucial information about the corruption's source and progression, but only to those who prove their commitment to cleansing the land. He knows:
- The exact timing of Vorlag's arrival and first corruptions
- Which animals fled versus which stayed and became corrupted
- The path to the whispering grove
- How to take part of the ritual to perform in order to summon druid spirits
- Not how to lift the PC's curse but can point to a sorcerer in Highmoon who maybe could : [[Amlug Tauriel (WIP)]]

### The Ancestor Mounds
Two very large stone mounds that served as a burial place for ancestors of the Vale. The legend says Erlan the Unbent, an Old Folk hero, sacrificed himself in a battle against the Myrkul envoy Zylkresk Mindeater in order to save the region. These sacred sites are parts of the plan of Vorlag's and she will desecrate and steal relics from them, corrupting their ancient purpose.

**Layout:**
- The mounds are a mile from the village edge
- Ancient burial sites of the "Old Folk" and tribal chieftains
- Considered sacred ground that people should leave alone especially after dark
- Rich with old magic and ancestral spirits (now corrupted)

**Current State:**
- Disturbed earth from necromantic activities
- Unnatural cold spots that linger
- Areas where undead have emerged from the ground
- Crude necromantic symbols scrawled on ancient stones
- One remaining relic hidden within: **Erlan's Unbendable Resolve** (Vorlag has already stolen **The Phalanx of Whispers**)

**Hidden Relics:**

**Erlan's Unbendable Resolve**
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This humble-looking charm is a smooth, grey river stone, worn flat over centuries, and bound in a loop of petrified ironwood root. It feels warm to the touch and radiates a faint sense of calm and courage. It was Erlan's personal focus, a connection to the enduring life of the Dalelands that he used to remind him his resolve against Zylkresk's terror.

*Power (for the Adventurers):*
The charm has 3 charges. As an action, you can present the charm and expend 1 charge to create a wave of positive energy in a 15-foot cone. Each undead creature in that cone must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the charm's connection to Erlan's spirit is exhausted, and not returning the stone to his grave gives you 1 exhaustion status.

On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 radiant damage and is turned for 1 minute or until it takes more damage. On a successful save, the creature only takes 1d6 radiant damage.
The charm regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

**The Phalanx of Whispers** *(Stolen by Vorlag)*
*Wondrous item, uncommon (cursed)*

This jagged, blackened finger bone gleams with a cold, greasy light. It is unnaturally heavy and cold to the touch, and holding it for more than a few seconds fills a non-evil creature's mind with faint, overlapping whispers of fear and doubt. This is a relic of Zylkresk, a focus for his power to break the will of mortals. Vorlag has already claimed this artifact from the mounds, leaving behind only disturbed earth and necromantic corruption.

**Encounter: Ancestral Spirits' Guidance**
The spirits of the Old Folk ancestors manifest to those who approach with respect and pure intentions. These translucent figures provide warnings about Vorlag's plans and offer blessings to cleanse their desecrated resting place. The spirits can:
- Grant temporary protection against undead (advantage on saves vs. undead for 24 hours)
- Reveal the password for the [[Thornwall Keep]]
- Teach the ancient words needed to activate [[The Whispering Grove]] cleansing rituals
- Show visions of Vorlag's probable target sites
- Provide the true history of Erlan the Unbent's sacrifice and Zylkresk Mindeater's defeat


### Dragon's Tooth Bum
A cavern seemingly going deep inside the dragon's tooth mountains, a chain of hills and small mountains. The tallest one ressembles a Dragon's tooth, hence the name. The mountains are inhabited mostly by creatures like goblins and gnolls whom established tribal camps there. No human tried to venture further than a few dozen yards inside the bum by fear of never coming back.

**Encounter: Dragon Cult Outpost**
Hidden within the cavern system is a recently established outpost of the Cult of the Dragon. The cultists use this location to monitor the region and spy on Vorlag's activities, viewing the necromancer as a potential rival rather than ally.

**Outpost Layout:**
- Guard post at the cavern entrance (2 cultists on rotating watch)
- Main chamber with sleeping quarters for 8 cultists
- Ritual chamber with dragonclaw altar and scrying focus
- Storage area containing supplies and surveillance equipment

**Cultist Forces:**
- 6 Cultists (CR 1/8 each) armed with scimitars and light crossbows
- 1 Cult Fanatic (CR 2) serving as outpost commander
- 1 Guard Drake (CR 2) kept as a guardian creature
- Rotating patrols of 2-3 cultists throughout the day

**Intelligence Gathered:**
- Detailed surveillance reports on Vorlag's movements and activities
- Maps marking locations where undead have been spotted
- Plans to recruit local monsters before Vorlag can corrupt them
- Lists of magical artifacts both cults are competing to claim
- Evidence of ongoing spy networks watching each other's operations


### The Whispering Grove
A circular clearing deep in Direwood where ancient druids once gathered. The trees here grow in perfect symmetry, and on certain nights, whispers of old rituals can still be heard on the wind. It is impossible to find it uninvited.

**Encounter: Ritual Circle Activation**
The ritual circle in the center can be activated to reveal hidden magical connections across the Vale, but only with the ancient words taught by the spirits at [[The Ancestor Mounds]]. When properly activated, the circle reveals:

**Magical Revelations:**
- Leyline network connecting all Old Folk sites across the region
- Current locations of Vorlag's corruption "anchor points"
- Times when magical barriers between planes are strongest/weakest
- Hidden caches of druidic supplies and healing herbs throughout Direwood

**Cleansing Rituals Learned:**
- Ritual to purify corrupted water sources (requires moonwater and silver dust)
- Ward creation to protect small areas from undead intrusion (8-hour duration, requires holy water)
- Cure curse-afflicted individuals but become exhausted 

### Thornwall Keep (Ruins)
The remnants of an old fortification on a hill overlooking the river valley, built to guard against threats from the Direwood. Now mostly collapsed, but its cellars might still hold treasures or dangers.

**Encounter: The Undead Garrison**
The keep's former garrison still "guards" the ruins as skeletal soldiers and zombified officers. They attack any intruders who cannot provide the proper military passwords from decades past. The undead force includes:
- 8 Skeleton warriors with rusted chainmail and weapons
- 2 Zombie sergeants with partial plate armor
- 1 Wight captain in the main hall who retains tactical knowledge
- Various undead sentries that patrol the ramparts on a predictable schedule

**Tactical Notes:**
- The undead follow military formations and retreat to defensive positions when threatened
- They can be bypassed with successful History (DC 18) or Investigation (DC 15) checks to discover old military protocols or by learning the password from the ancestral spirit.
- The captain's office contains maps showing patrol routes and defensive strategies
- The keep's foundations extend deep into the hillside with multiple levels

**Reward:**
- Armors and weapons
- Fortified place to rest (if undeads defeated)

### The Singing Stones
A collection of standing stones along the river that hum in certain weather conditions. Local folklore claims they were placed by the Old Folk to mark safe crossing points.

**Encounter: Hidden Messages & Ancient Communication**
The stones reveal hidden messages when approached during specific weather conditions (mist, rain, or strong wind). Successfully interpreting their meaning (Investigation DC 16 or History DC 14) reveals:

**Weather-Based Messages:**
- During mist: Existence of shadow elementals  of safe river crossings and ford markers
- During rain: Existence of and summoning words for Ondrea, the water elemental
- During wind: Times when supernatural activity peaks in the Vale

**Learning the Songs:**
Characters who spend time studying the stones' harmonics can learn to communicate with other Old Folk sites across the region. This ancient network allows:
- Sending simple messages to [[River Stillwater]]'s water elemental
- Receiving warnings from [[The Ancestor Mounds]] about approaching dangers
- Coordinating with other resistance groups fighting Vorlag's influence
- Accessing the collective memory of the Old Folk's magical knowledge

### Shadowmere Pool
A deep, dark pool fed by an underground spring, located east on the other side of the river. Locals avoid it, claiming it's cursed, but it serves as a natural scrying focus for those with the knowledge to use it.

**Encounter: Shadow Guardians & Scrying Bargain**
Attempting to use the pool for scrying awakens 2d4 Shadow creatures that emerge from the dark water to test intruders. These shadows are not malevolent but serve as guardians of the pool's power.

**Combat Challenge:**
- Shadows have standard stats but regenerate 2 HP per turn while in contact with the pool
- They can be negotiated with (Persuasion DC 15) rather than fought
- Defeating or convincing them grants access to the pool's scrying abilities

**The Pool Spirit's Bargain:**
Once the shadows are dealt with, the pool's ancient spirit offers to scry for the party but demands a significant personal sacrifice:
- A treasured memory (permanent loss of proficiency in one skill)
- A year of natural lifespan (aging effects but no mechanical penalties)  
- A personal item of great sentimental value (must be something the character truly cherishes)

**Scrying Visions Possible:**
- Vorlag's current location and immediate plans
- The location of other cursed individuals in the region
- Safe routes to major cities for seeking help
- Hidden weaknesses in Vorlag's defenses or magic

### Fenwater Crossing & The Ferryman's Hut

The main north-south road in the Vale crosses the River Stillwater at a wide, slow-moving point a half-day's ride south of the village. There is no bridge, only a large, sturdy raft-ferry operated by an old, reclusive ferryman named Silas.

**Characteristics:**

- The ferry is large enough for a horse and cart. Silas poles it across the river using a guide rope.
- Silas's small, moss-covered hut sits on the western bank, marked by a perpetually smoking chimney.
- Silas is tight-lipped but observant. He sees everyone who comes and goes along the road and can be a valuable source of rumors if plied with coin or drink.

**Encounter: Silas the Informant**
Silas (human male, age 65) has a sudden/indirect voice with nasal placement, dry air quality, and quiet volume. His voice carries a friendly but cautious tone. He provides safe passage and valuable intelligence in exchange for protection from recent threats:

**Information Silas Provides:**
- Detailed descriptions of all travelers who've crossed in the past month
- Strange cargo transported by hooded figures (bone dust, grave dirt, preserved organs)
- Times when unnatural mists rise from the river
- Locations where he's seen lights moving at night across the water
- Routes that mysterious travelers avoid (suggesting they know of specific dangers)

**Protection Needed:**
- Recent threats from corrupted river creatures
- Bandits who've been demanding "protection fees"
- Strange visitors who ask too many questions about regular travelers
- His growing fear that someone is watching his ferry operations

### Old Mage Mansion's Ruins
It is said an old mage used to live there a few centuries back. Villagers say that there is nothing to see here besides old stones.

**Encounter: Hidden Laboratory Discovery**
Beneath the "empty" ruins lies a concealed magical laboratory, accessible through a secret entrance (Investigation DC 17 to locate). The laboratory contains:

**Research Materials:**
- Extensive notes on planar convergences and the Shadowfell's influence
- Detailed maps showing leyline intersections throughout the Vale
- Formulae for creating protective wards against necromantic magic
- Experimental journals documenting attempts to strengthen planar barriers
- Correspondence with other mages about "thinning veils" and supernatural threats

**Magical Equipment:**
- Alchemy station with rare reagents for ward creation
- Crystal focusing array for detecting planar disturbances
- Preserved specimens of creatures from the Shadowfell
- Enchanted tools for magical research and ward construction
- Hidden cache of spell scrolls (2d4 scrolls of 1st-3rd level abjuration spells)

**Current State:**
- Most equipment is still functional despite the centuries
- Magical preservation keeps research notes readable
- Some experiments were left incomplete, requiring investigation to understand
- The laboratory's wards still function, protecting it from detection and intrusion

### Old Folk's Bridge
A stone bridge that used to cross the river in the past. People say it's been built by the old folks and that it's probably been destroyed by a flood.

**Encounter: Bridge Trolls' Territory**
Two river trolls have claimed the underwater bridge ruins as their domain. These creatures are not mindlessly aggressive but follow a twisted code of "payment" for crossing their territory:

**The Trolls' Demands:**
- Krogg (larger troll): Demands a "memory of fear" - targets must relive their most terrifying experience aloud
- Murl (smaller, cleverer troll): Wants a "piece of tomorrow" - targets must sacrifice a planned goal or aspiration
- Both accept alternative payments: magical items, rare foods, or entertaining stories

**Combat Considerations:**
- Trolls fight in coordinated attacks, using the underwater terrain to their advantage
- They retreat if reduced to 1/4 health, preferring to negotiate rather than die
- Krogg has standard troll stats; Murl has +2 Intelligence and can cast minor illusion spells
- The underwater ruins provide cover and difficult terrain for both sides

**Bridge Secrets:**
- The bridge's foundation stones contain a still-active teleportation circle
- Circle connects to other Old Folk sites when activated with proper ritual words
- Trolls are unaware of the circle's magic, using it only as a comfortable lair
- Successfully negotiating with trolls grants access to their knowledge of river traffic and seasonal changes

### The Halfling's Farm
Owned by Finzin Arnberry, living alone in the western hills across the river. Finzin could probably have some information about other halfling communities which could interest Yuyu.

**Encounter: Farm Under Siege & Safe Haven**
Finzin's farm is currently under attack by corrupted dire boars and wolves when the party arrives. The halfling farmer (voice: sudden/direct, light weight, mid volume, friendly tone) desperately needs rescue.

**Combat Encounter:**
- 3 Dire boars with glowing red eyes and foam-flecked mouths
- 4 Corrupted wolves that attack in coordinated pack tactics
- Creatures focus on destroying crops and livestock rather than killing
- Finzin fights with a farming scythe (treat as glaive) and knows the terrain advantage

**Finzin's Assistance:**
Once rescued, Finzin provides multiple forms of aid:
- **Safe House**: Farm serves as a secure base of operations with early warning systems
- **Halfling Network**: Detailed knowledge of halfling communities within 100 miles
- **Supply Routes**: Known trails used by small folk traders and messengers
- **Local Intelligence**: Information about strange behavior in local wildlife
- **Provisions**: Access to preserved foods, healing herbs, and basic equipment

**Farm's Defenses:**
- Reinforced root cellar for secure storage and shelter
- Hidden caches of supplies in various outbuildings
- Trained guard dog that can detect undead approach
- Signal system to alert distant neighbors of danger


## Regional Settlements & Travel

### Connections to the [[Dalelands]]

The Stillwater Vale sits between [[Mistledale]] and [[Deepingdale]], providing strategic access to both major Dale settlements while remaining isolated from the main conflicts affecting the [[Dalelands]] region.

**[[Ashabenford]] ([[Mistledale]]):**
**Distance:** 50 miles northeast - 3 days' travel
**Route:** The Mistledale Track through northern Direwood, then follow Moonsea ride east
**Features:**
- Main settlement and seat of [[Mistledale]]
- Established trade routes and merchants
- Dale council and local governance
- Potential source of aid for curse investigation (Path 2)

**[[Highmoon]] ([[Deepingdale]]):**
**Distance:** 55 miles southeast but 135 miles following River Stillwater
**Route Options:**
- *River Route:* 6-7 days following Stillwater southeast (safer but longer)
**Features:**
- Seat of [[Deepingdale]] governance
- Agricultural center with temples and healing services
- River route offers safer travel for cursed characters
- Major Dale settlement with resources for curse research

### Regional Settlements

**Scattered Homesteads & Hamlets:**
Most settlements between the Vale and the main Dale cities are:
- Small farming communities (1-2 days apart)
- Isolated homesteads along river tributaries  
- Abandoned settlements reclaimed by wilderness
- Trading posts at trail junctions

**Travel Considerations:**
- Standard travel: 24 miles/day maximum on good roads
- Forest/wilderness travel: 12-18 miles/day depending on conditions
- Cursed characters may face additional delays from undead encounters
- Weather and seasonal conditions significantly affect travel times

### Scattered Settlements
The Vale beyond major settlements is sparsely populated:
- Isolated farmsteads along river tributaries
- Small hamlets in forest clearings
- Abandoned settlements reclaimed by wilderness
- Hermit dwellings and hidden refuges


## Supernatural Elements

### Planar Convergence
The Stillwater Vale sits on a confluence of weakened planar energiesâ€”a "thin spot" to the Shadowfell. This makes the area particularly susceptible to:
- Necromantic magic and undead influences
- Supernatural creatures crossing between planes
- Lingering spirits and ghostly manifestations
- Areas where the boundary between life and death grows thin

### Leyline Network
Ancient magical energies flow beneath the landscape:
- Concentrated around the Ancestor Mounds
- Affected by celestial events (new moons strengthen the connection)
- Can be tapped by those with knowledge of the old ways
- Currently being exploited by Vorlag for her dark purposes

## Climate and Seasons

The Vale experiences a temperate climate with distinct seasons that affect both natural and supernatural elements:

**Spring:** Rivers run high, forest awakens, but also when restless spirits are most active
**Summer:** Peaceful and prosperous, supernatural activity at its lowest
**Autumn:** Harvest time, but also when the veil between worlds grows thin
**Winter:** Harsh and isolating, when dark magic is strongest and travel becomes dangerous

## Current Threats

Since Vorlag's arrival, the Vale is starting to face unprecedented dangers:
- Undead emerging from corrupted burial sites
- Increased aggressive wildlife driven from deeper forest
- Supernatural cold and blight affecting crops and livestock
- Strange lights and sounds in the night
- Disappearances of travelers and isolated settlers
