# Featherdale - The Diminished Haven

**Population:** 18,000 (sandwiched dale, no major city, farms, halflings)  
**Status:** Struggling Dale - Intermittent contact, countryside half abandoned, population concentrated in Feather Falls  
**Capital:** Feather Falls (largest town, refugee center)

## Regional Description

Featherdale was once a peaceful agricultural dale known for its halfling communities and abundant farms. Sandwiched between larger dales, it has always been quiet and pastoral. The dale's lack of major fortifications and military forces made it vulnerable to [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)#Basic Information|Vorlag the Pale]]'s subtle infiltration tactics. The undead threat has been more insidious here than elsewhere, with corruption spreading slowly through the countryside while the population remains largely unaware of the full scope of the danger.

## Current State

**Rural Areas:** Half abandoned, with many farmsteads empty and fields lying fallow. Undead presence is scattered but growing, using guerrilla tactics rather than open warfare.

**Feather Falls:** Overcrowded with rural refugees, but the halfling community's resilience and cooperation help manage the crisis better than in other dales.

**Communication:** Intermittent contact with neighboring dales due to dangerous travel conditions and lack of organized messenger services.

## Strategic Importance

Featherdale's agricultural resources and position between major dales make it valuable for supply lines and communications. Vorlag's strategy here focuses on slow corruption and resource denial rather than direct conquest, weakening the overall region's ability to resist her expansion. The dale's halfling population's resilience provides a model for community-based resistance that could inspire other regions if properly supported.
