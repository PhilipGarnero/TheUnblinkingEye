# The Dalelands - Post-Second Sundering Era

*Current information reflecting the state of the Dalelands after the global catastrophe and under the growing influence of Vorlag the Pale*

## Geographic Overview

The Dalelands remain elven forest vales surrounding the great woodland of Cormanthor, but the Second Sundering has left lasting scars on the region. What was once a loose confederation of independent communities now struggles with fractured connections, diminished resources, and the creeping influence of necromantic corruption.

### Current Population & Demographics
- **Estimated Population:** ~380,000 (down from 602,640 pre-Sundering)
- **Primary Race:** Human (75%, down from 80% due to casualties and migration)
- **Other Races:** Halfling (4%), Drow (8%), Elf (6%), Dwarf (3%), Other (4%)
- **Population Changes:** Moderate decline due to Sundering disruption and some migration to larger cities

## Political Landscape

### Weakened Dales Council
The traditional Dales Council structure persists but has been severely weakened:
- **Irregular Meetings:** Annual gatherings often cancelled due to lack of interest
- **Fractured Communication:** Several dales have lost regular contact with others
- **Authority Erosion:** Individual dale leaders increasingly focused on local interests

### Current Dale Status

**Functioning Dales:**
- **Mistledale** (Ashabenford): Maintains some stability, acts as regional hub
- **Deepingdale** (Highmoon): Agricultural center, some temple presence
- **Shadowdale** (Shadowdale): Historically significant but increasingly isolated

**Struggling Dales:**
- **Battledale** (Essembra): Overrun by monsters, largely abandoned
- **Featherdale** (Feather Falls): Intermittent contact, unknown current status
- **Tasseldale** (Tasseler): Reported undead activity, evacuations underway

**Status Unknown:**
- Several outer dales have not been heard from in months

## Post-Sundering Changes

### Magical Instability
The Second Sundering left the region magically unstable:
- **Leyline Disruption:** Ancient magical networks fractured and unpredictable
- **Planar Thin Spots:** Increased areas where the Shadowfell bleeds through
- **Wild Magic Zones:** Unpredictable magical effects in certain areas
- **Weakened Wards:** Protective barriers around settlements failing

### Ecological Impact
- **Cormanthor Corruption:** Sections of the great forest show signs of blight
- **Undead Emergence:** Previously stable graveyards and burial sites disturbed
- **Wildlife Displacement:** Natural creatures fleeing corrupted areas
- **Climate Anomalies:** Unnatural cold spots and areas of perpetual twilight

### Infrastructure Collapse
- **Road Networks:** Many traditional trade routes unsafe or impassable
- **Communication Lines:** Messenger services unreliable or nonexistent
- **Supply Chains:** Critical shortages of goods, medicine, and magical components
- **Defensive Capabilities:** Most dales lack resources for proper militias

## Vorlag's Growing Influence

### Areas Under Direct Threat
- **The Stillwater Vale:** Primary staging ground for Vorlag's operations
- **Eastern Mistledale:** Reports of undead activity and missing persons
- **Northern Deepingdale:** Corrupted burial mounds and desecrated shrines
- **Cormanthor Borderlands:** Necromantic experiments in forest ruins

### Patterns of Corruption
**Phase 1 - Infiltration:**
- Isolated homesteads and small settlements targeted first
- Corruption of local burial sites and shrines
- Recruitment or domination of desperate survivors

**Phase 2 - Establishment:**
- Creation of undead strongholds in strategic locations
- Disruption of local governance and religious authority
- Spread of fear and despair among remaining populations

**Phase 3 - Expansion:**
- Open undead activity and territorial claims
- Corruption of natural areas and magical sites
- Preparation for larger necromantic rituals

### Regional Response
**Organized Resistance:**
- **Temple Networks:** Remaining clerics coordinate anti-undead efforts
- **Adventuring Companies:** Small groups hired for specific threats
- **Dale Militias:** What remains of organized military forces

**Civilian Response:**
- **Cautious Optimism:** Most communities have returned to normal routines
- **Local Vigilance:** Increased attention to unusual events, though often dismissed
- **Informal Networks:** Neighbors checking on each other more frequently

## Subtle Threats and Concerns

### Strange Incidents
While major threats seem contained, unsettling patterns emerge:
- **Animal Behavior:** Wildlife acting strangely, avoiding certain areas
- **Sleep Disturbances:** Increased reports of nightmares and restless sleep
- **Minor Disappearances:** Occasional missing persons, usually attributed to accidents
### Monster Incursions
Post-Sundering magical instability has drawn dangerous creatures:
- **Aberrations:** Creatures from the Far Realm exploit planar weaknesses
- **Fiends:** Demons and devils seeking footholds in the chaos
- **Undead:** Because of Vorlag's, wild undead rise from disturbed grounds
### Persistent Post-Sundering Issues
Some lingering effects from the catastrophe remain:
- **Magical Instabilities:** Occasional wild magic surges in remote areas
- **Bandit Groups:** Small opportunistic groups, more nuisance than major threat
- **Trade Disruptions:** Minor delays and route changes due to residual dangers

### Environmental Anomalies
- **Cold Spots:** Unexplained areas of persistent chill, dismissed as weather patterns
- **Crop Variations:** Some fields producing different yields without clear cause
- **Water Changes:** Subtle alterations in taste or clarity of some water sources

## Opportunities for Adventurers

### Investigation Opportunities
- **Missing Persons:** Looking into the occasional disappearances
- **Strange Phenomena:** Investigating unusual animal behavior and environmental changes
- **Historical Research:** Studying old records for patterns of similar events
- **Community Relations:** Helping nervous communities feel more secure

### Long-Term Goals
- **Infrastructure Restoration:** Rebuilding communication and trade networks
- **Political Reunification:** Helping restore the Dales Council
- **Magical Stabilization:** Addressing the root causes of planar instability
- **Vorlag's Defeat:** Eliminating the primary necromantic threat

## Notable Locations

### Surviving Strongholds
- **Ashabenford Citadel:** Last major fortification in Mistledale
- **Highmoon Temples:** Remaining center of divine power
- **Hidden Sanctuaries:** Secret refuges for resistance fighters

### Corrupted Sites
- **Thornwall Keep:** Ancient fortress now serves as undead stronghold
- **The Weeping Mounds:** Burial sites corrupted by necromantic energy
- **Shadowmere Pool:** Scrying focus turned into portal anchor point

### Neutral Territories
- **Trader's Rest:** Fortified way station maintaining neutrality
- **The Singing Stones:** Ancient site with protective properties
- **Deepwood Enclaves:** Hidden communities of forest dwellers

## Campaign Implications

This transformed Dalelands provides:
- **Urgency:** Clear time pressure as Vorlag's influence spreads
- **Scope:** Multiple scales of conflict from personal to regional
- **Complexity:** Political, magical, and environmental challenges
- **Agency:** Multiple approaches to addressing the threats
- **Consequence:** Player actions have meaningful impact on regional recovery

The region serves as both backdrop and active participant in the unfolding story, with the fate of the Dalelands hanging in the balance as Vorlag works toward her master's return.
