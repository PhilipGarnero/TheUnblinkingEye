## History
**Broken Beginnings:** Born Lovgar Sunstone with skin pale as winter moonlight, she endured a childhood marked by abandonment and suffering. Orphaned at seven when plague claimed her parents, she was cast into the care of a brutal monastery where the overseers saw her ethereal beauty as both temptation and commodity. Her porcelain features and translucent skin drew unwanted touches from visiting nobles and merchants, while the jealous matrons punished her for attractions she neither sought nor understood. Beaten for being too beautiful, starved for being too proud, she learned that her ghostly pallor made her both valuable and reviled—a living reminder of death's touch that men desired and women feared.

**The Desperate Escape:** At sixteen, when the monastery's head priest attempted to sell her to a visiting lord as a "bride," Lovgar finally broke. She fled into the wilderness during a winter storm, preferring death to further degradation. For days she wandered, her pale skin nearly invisible against the snow, until exhaustion and exposure brought her to the edge of death. She collapsed in the ancient ruins where dark magic still lingered, her fading life force drawn to the necromantic energies that pulsed through the cursed stones. There, balanced between life and death, she lay dying when fate brought her salvation.

**The Savior's Shadow:** When [[Lysander Grimheart]] found her dying in ancient ruins, her pale beauty struck him like a vision—an angel fallen from grace, her alabaster skin almost luminous against the dark stones. He became her secret protector, enrolling her as a cleric of Ilmater while hiding her existence from his wife. But salvation came with its own torment—his infrequent visits left her yearning for the only person who had ever looked upon her pallid features with kindness rather than hunger. In the temple's cold halls, surrounded by prayers of suffering and mercy, she found little comfort in Ilmater's teachings.

**Shar's Whispered Promises:** The goddess of loss and darkness spoke to Lovgar's wounded heart where Ilmater's light could not reach. Shar understood abandonment, betrayal, the ache of unrequited devotion. In secret midnight prayers, Lovgar found solace in embracing the pain rather than seeking to heal it. Shar taught her that suffering was not meant to be endured—it was meant to be wielded.

**The Forbidden Knowledge:** When Lysander presented her with the indecipherable tome containing necromantic lore of [[The Dusk Lord]], Lovgar saw opportunity disguised as intellectual challenge. Already steeped in Shar's darker mysteries, she proved receptive to the ancient lich's whispered teachings that seeped from the cursed pages. The book became her gateway to power—power to never again be abandoned or helpless.

**The Ultimate Betrayal:** Years of growing resentment culminated in her desperate confession of love to Lysander. His gentle rejection shattered the last remnants of Lovgar Sunstone. In that moment of absolute despair, she enacted the ritual that would transform both their fates—binding him as her ghoul servant while completing her own metamorphosis into Vorlag the Pale. If he would never love her freely, he would serve her eternally.

**Servant of the Dusk Lord:** Through the forbidden tome's influence and her mastery of Shar's teachings, Vorlag attracted the attention of [[The Dusk Lord]] himself. The ancient lich recognized her potential and claimed her as his devoted lieutenant. In serving him, she found the purpose that had eluded her mortal life—to bring about a world where the abandoned and forgotten would rise to claim dominion over those who had scorned them.

**Current Mission:** Restore [[The Dusk Lord]] to power in the Material Plane

**Goals:**
- **Primary Goal:** Weaken barriers between Material Plane and Shadowfell within the Dalelands to facilitate her master's return
- **Immediate Goals:**
  * Claim strategic locations like [[Stillwater Creek - Village Index]] to anchor master's influence
  * Build undead army for Dusk Lord's initial forces
  * Eliminate or corrupt divine servants and regional threats
  * Study and exploit leyline convergences and planar weak points

**Methods:** The cursing of PCs with [[The Death's Eye]] serves multiple purposes: marking them as potential servants, using them as unwitting agents to spread necromantic corruption, and demonstrating her growing power.
