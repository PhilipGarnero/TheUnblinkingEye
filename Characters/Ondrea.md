## Description
Ondrea appears as a graceful humanoid figure composed entirely of clear, flowing water. Her form shimmers and ripples constantly, sometimes revealing glimpses of fish, water plants, and river stones within her translucent body. When agitated, her waters become turbulent and dark. Her voice sounds like gentle rapids over stones, with words that seem to flow and cascade.

## History
Ondrea has been the guardian spirit of River Stillwater for centuries, bound to protect its waters and the life they sustain. She remembers the Old Folk who first settled the Vale and witnessed Erlan the Unbent's heroic sacrifice against the Myrkul envoy Zylkresk Mindeater. She has watched over the river as it flows north to south from the misty foothills of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains through the Vale's verdant landscape.

As an ancient being connected to the leyline network beneath the Vale, Ondrea possesses deep knowledge of the region's magical history. She knows the true names of ancient powers, the locations of sacred sites, and the ritual words passed down from the Old Folk. Recently, she has become increasingly troubled by necromantic corruption seeping into her domain, which taints her pure waters and disrupts the natural balance.

Her primary motivation is to cleanse the River Stillwater and its tributaries of Vorlag's corruption. She only manifests to those who have successfully interpreted [[The Singing Stones]] messages, recognizing them as worthy allies in her fight against the spreading darkness.
