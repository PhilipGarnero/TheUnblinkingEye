## Description

Weathered man with kind eyes and silver-streaked hair, often wearing simple robes and carrying worn leather satchel filled with herbs and old texts. Hands gnarled from years tending shrine, but voice remains strong when speaking of village's history and traditions.

**Role:** Caretaker of Shrine of Ancestors/River Spirit and village historian

**Knowledge:**
- **What He Knows:** Village history and spiritual traditions, basic undead/necromancy theory, locations of potential help (temples, sages, sanctuaries), significance of Ancestor Mounds and their corruption
- **What He Doesn't Know:** Specific details about [[The Death's Eye]] curse, how to lift necromantic curses, advanced magical or divine remedies

**Goals:** *Protect village and guide people through spiritual matters, though acknowledges limitations in helping with curse*

## Relationships

- **Shrine:** Primary caretaker of sacred sites

**Player Characters:** Sympathetic but honest about limitations - "I have served this shrine for forty years, child, but the evil that marks you now is beyond my humble knowledge. You must seek those with greater wisdom than mine."

## Quests
**Quests He Provides:**
- Establishing new burial grounds (consecrating the fallen)
- Guidance directing PCs to potential sources of aid
- Spiritual counsel and village history exposition

**Information He Provides:**
- **Path 2 hooks:** Sage Hemlock Grimsby in Oakhaven, Temple of Sun God in Veridia, distant lands free from necromantic taint
- **Path 3 options:** Information about fleeing Vorlag's influence

**Key Dialogue:** "For your own sakes, and for the peace of this village, you must seek a cure elsewhere. Your presence now, marked by [[The Death's Eye]], will only bring more fear... and perhaps more of [[Vorlag the Pale (Necromancer)]]'s attention."
