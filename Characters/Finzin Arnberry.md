He dresses practically for farm work but always keeps his clothes clean when coming to market. His hands are calloused from honest work, and he has a ready smile for potential customers.

## History
Finzin settled his farm across the river about fifteen years ago, drawn by the fertile soil and peaceful location near Stillwater Creek. He makes regular trips to the village to sell his exceptional vegetables, fruits, and herbs. Before settling down, he traveled extensively among halfling communities throughout the region, giving him valuable knowledge of other settlements and safe routes between them. He's built a reputation for fair dealing and quality produce, making him a welcome sight at the village market.
