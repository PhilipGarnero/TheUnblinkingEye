## History
**The Partnership:** Decades ago, when Vorlag was promising young cleric studying ancient texts, Lysander was her companion and protector. They served together in temple, investigating undead activity reports.

**The Corruption:** During expedition to cleanse ancient crypt, Vorlag discovered forbidden necromantic knowledge. Lysander tried to stop her from pursuing dark arts, but she had already begun transformation.

**The Betrayal:** When Lysander attempted to report Vorlag's corruption to superiors, she made terrible choice. Rather than kill him outright, she used ritual to slowly transform him into ghoul, making him watch as divine powers abandoned him.

**The Binding:** Transformation was deliberate and personal. Vorlag ensured Lysander retained enough original personality to understand his fall, creating perfect servant embodying her victory over divine righteousness.
